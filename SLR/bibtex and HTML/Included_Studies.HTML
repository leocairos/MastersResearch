	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Systematic mapping provides an overview of a research area to assess the quantity of evidence existing on a topic of interest. In spite of its relevance, the establishment of consistent categories and classification of primary studies in these categories are manually conducted. Objective: We propose an approach, named SM-VTM (Systematic Mapping based on Visual Text Mining), to support categorization and classification stages in the systematic mapping using Visual Text Mining (VTM), aiming at reducing time and effort required in this process. Method: We established SM-VTM, selected a VTM tool and conducted a case study comparing results of two systematic mappings: one performed manually and another using our approach. Results: The results of both systematic mappings were very similar, showing the viability of SM-VTM. Furthermore, since our approach was applied using a tool, reduction of time and effort can be achieved. Conclusions: The application of VTM seems to be very relevant in the context of systematic mapping.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Context: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are an important component to identify and aggregate research evidence from different empirical studies. Despite its relevance, most of the process is conducted manually, implying additional effort when the Selection Review task is performed and leading to reading all studies under analysis more than once. Objective: We propose an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques to assist the Selection Review task in SLR. It is implemented into a VTM tool (Revis), which is freely available for use. Method: We have selected and implemented appropriate visualization techniques into our approach and validated and demonstrated its usefulness in performing real SLRs. Results: The results have shown that employment of VTM techniques can successfully assist in the Selection Review task, speeding up the entire SLR process in comparison to the conventional approach. Conclusion: VTM techniques are valuable tools to be used in the context of selecting studies in the SLR process, prone to speed up some stages of SLRs. textcopyright 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In order to preserve the value of Systematic Reviews (SRs), they should be frequently updated considering new evidence that has been produced since the completion of the previous version of the reviews. However, the update of an SR is a time consuming, manual task. Thus, many SRs have not been updated as they should be and, therefore, they are currently outdated. Objective: The main contribution of this paper is to support the update of SRs. Method: We propose USR-VTM, an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques, to support selection of new evidence in the form of primary studies. We then present a tool, named Revis, which supports our approach. Finally, we evaluate our approach through a comparison of outcomes achieved using USR-VTM versus the traditional (manual) approach. Results: Our results show that USR-VTM increases the number of studies correctly included compared to the traditional approach. Conclusions: USR-VTM effectively supports the update of SRs.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is an information-based process throughout which each stage must be carefully and systematically designed in planning phase. Important decisions need to be made about the various choices involved in the SLR planning phase. However, due to the necessarily comprehensive and rigorous nature of SLR, many researchers have difficulties in planning SLRs sufficiently and effectively. In recent decades, the use of text mining (TM) techniques has been introduced to facilitate SLR process, especially at conducting review phase to support the searching and selection of studies. However, so far, TM techniques have not been applied to support any activities during SLR planning phase. In this research, we proposed a method that apply Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) method to support decision-making activities within the SLR planning phase. This method also known as SLR Planning Based on Suffix Tree Clustering (SLRP-STC) method. It aims to help reviewers in three ways: 1) to extract research topics easily; 2) to better interpret extracted information; and 3) to quickly realize and refine a proposed search string that is poorly formulated or inappropriate. A case study was conducted by comparing the proposed method with manual approach. It is observed that the use of SLRP-STC method can improve the planning of SLR.

Method: To update these two SLRs, we used automated techniques based on VTM (Visual Text Mining) to guarantee the presence of relevant studies. Results: From our experience, some factors to satisfactorily update SLRs were identified: (i) to adopt software tools to support the updating process; (ii) to provide as much as possible information of previous SLR; (iii) to involve researchers from previous SLR; and (iv) to reuse protocol from preliminar SLR.

Aiming at alleviating this costly process, we propose an iterative method to support the process of building the search string for a systematic review. This method uses Visual Text Mining techniques to support the researcher by suggesting new terms for the string. In order to do so, the method extracts relevant terms from studies selected by the researcher and displays them in a way that facilitate their visualization and supports building and refining the search string. In order to check the feasibility of this approach, we developed a tool that implements the proposed method. Interviews with researchers identified their difficulties in performing systematic reviews and captured their feedback with regards the use of the proposed method in a user study. The researchers indicated that this approach could be used to improve the process of building the search strings for systematic reviews. The study indicates that our approach can be used to facilitate the construction of the systematic literature review search string. Copyright 2015 ACM.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort. Text classification is useful in determining the statistical significance level of association rules to reduce workload in the systematic review. Several approaches to generate a Rule set for rule based classifiers were proposed in the literature. In this paper, we show that statistic as well as semantic measures of a rule can be combined and effectively computed as a hybrid feature selection rule measure (HFSRM). Moreover, we propose a new algorithm called Rules7-hybrid feature selection (Rules7-HFSRM) by combining the classical algorithm Rules7 and the HFSRM and then used it on the systematic review problem. Our results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms in the systematic review context.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Creating systematic reviews is a painstaking task undertaken especially in domains where experimental results are the primary method to knowledge creation. For the review authors, analysing documents to extract relevant data is a demanding activity. To support the creation of systematic reviews, we have created DASyR-a semi-automatic document analysis system. DASyR is our solution to annotating published papers for the purpose of ontology population. For domains where dictionaries are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing, followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to extend the annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation domain. The reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies makes it a perfect domain to test on. We show the utility of DASyR through experimental results for different parameter values for the bootstrap procedure, evaluated in terms of annotator agreement, error rate, precision and recall.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) identifies, evaluates, and synthesizes the literature available for a given topic. This generally requires a significant human workload and has subjectivity bias that could affect the results of such a review. Automated document classification can be a valuable tool for recommending the selection of studies. In this article, we propose an automated pre-selection approach based on text mining and semantic enrichment techniques. Each document is firstly processed by a named entity extractor. The DBpedia URIs coming from the entity linking process are used as external sources of information. Our system collects the bag of words of those sources and it adds them to the initial document. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier discriminates whether the enriched document belongs to the positive example set or not. We used an existing manually performed SLR as benchmark data set. We trained our system with different configurations of relevant documents and we tested the goodness of our approach with an empirical assessment. Results show a reduction of the manual workload of 18&#37; that a human researcher has to spend, while holding a remarkable 95&#37; of recall, important condition for the nature itself of SLRs. We measure the effect of the enrichment process to the precision of the classifier and we observed a gain up to 5&#37;.

We explore a machine learning approach to support semi-automated search and selection in SLRs to address these weaknesses. Method. We 1) train a classiier on an initial set of papers, 2) extend this set of papers by automated search and snowballing, 3) have the researcher validate the top paper, selected by the classiier, and 4) update the set of papers and iterate the process until a stopping criterion is met.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: — The growing number of scientific publications and the availability of information in online repositories enable researchers to discover, analyze and maintain an updated state of the art bibliography. Indeed, few works explore this scenario in order to support researchers on the literature review step. Literature reviewing comprises a fundamental part of the scientific writing, in which publications are evaluated and selected by relevance. Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research. Experiments showed good results on learning performance when using a hybrid approach, increasing testing performance in 12&#37;, achieving 89.05&#37; in accuracy when classifying a paper as relevant.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question by interpreting the current pertinent literature. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort to the group of experts. Most of proposed works apply supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to infer exclusion and inclusion rules by observing a human screener. Unless, these techniques holds very little promise in study identification phase, because the rate of excluding citations erroneously still unreasonable. In this paper, we contribute to this line of works by proposing an alternative approach, not yet tested in this domain based on semantic rule-based classifiers. This approach involved applying a novel Hybrid Feature Selection Method (HFSM) within a Class Association Rules (CARs) algorithm. Experiments are conducted on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review. The obtained results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Literature reviews can be time-consuming and tedious to complete. By cataloging and refactoring three state-of-the-art active learning techniques from evidence-based medicine and legal electronic discovery, this paper finds and implements FASTREAD, a faster technique for studying a large corpus of documents. This paper assesses FASTREAD using datasets generated from existing SE literature reviews (Hall, Wahono, Radjenovic, Kitchenham et al.). Compared to manual methods, FASTREAD lets researchers find 95&#37; relevant studies after reviewing an order of magnitude fewer papers. Compared to other state-of-the-art automatic methods, FASTREAD reviews 20-50&#37; fewer studies while finding same number of relevant primary studies in a systematic literature review.
	<pre><p><b>Research Questions</b>:
<b>RQ1:</b> FASTREAD; Support vector machines (SVM) are a well-known and widely used classification technique; 
Active learning is a cost-aware machine learning algorithm where labels of training data can be acquired with certain costs; 
TfidfVectorizer in scikit-learn is utilized for the above preprocessing and featurization steps. 
Alternatives such as stemming, LDA [3], paragraph vectors [32] require further exploration and are scheduled in our future works. 
All 32 treatments use the same classifier– linear SVM from scikit-learn;
<b>RQ2:</b> three datasets are created reverse-engineering existing SLRs and being used in this study to simulate the process 
of excluding irrelevant studies; Our datasets are generated using information in the original SLR literature. 
Our candidate studies are retrieved by applying similar if not the same the search string from original SLR literature and search in IEEE Xplore;
<b>RQ3:</b> The performance of each algorithm is thus evaluated by its recall vs. studies reviewed curve; 
This performance metrics is suggested by [10, 11, 53] and best fits the objectives of excluding irrelevant studies problem; 
Table 2: Scott-Knott analysis for number of studies reviewed/ work saved over sampling to reach 95% recall; 
In general, active learning techniques can reduce cost in primary study selections with a sacrifice of(say 5%) recall; 
Our results and estimations suggest that FASTREAD can save more than 40% ofthe effort 
(associated with the primary selection study phase ofa literature review) while retrieving 95% ofthe “relevant” studies.
<b>RQ4:</b> selection; to reduce the effort required to exclude primary studies;
