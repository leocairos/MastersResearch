abstract = {In order to preserve the value of Systematic Reviews (SRs), they should be frequently updated considering new evidence that has been produced since the completion of the previous version of the reviews. However, the update of an SR is a time consuming, manual task. Thus, many SRs have not been updated as they should be and, therefore, they are currently outdated. Objective: The main contribution of this paper is to support the update of SRs. Method: We propose USR-VTM, an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques, to support selection of new evidence in the form of primary studies. We then present a tool, named Revis, which supports our approach. Finally, we evaluate our approach through a comparison of outcomes achieved using USR-VTM versus the traditional (manual) approach. Results: Our results show that USR-VTM increases the number of studies correctly included compared to the traditional approach. Conclusions: USR-VTM effectively supports the update of SRs.},

abstract = {In systematic reviews, the growing number of published studies imposes a significant screening workload on reviewers. Active learning is a promising approach to reduce the workload by automating some of the screening decisions, but it has been evaluated for a limited number of disciplines. The suitability of applying active learning to complex topics in disciplines such as social science has not been studied, and the selection of useful criteria and enhancements to address the data imbalance problem in systematic reviews remains an open problem. We applied active learning with two criteria (certainty and uncertainty) and several enhancements in both clinical medicine and social science (specifically, public health) areas, and compared the results in both. The results show that the certainty criterion is useful for finding relevant documents, and weighting positive instances is promising to overcome the data imbalance problem in both data sets. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is also shown to be promising when little manually-assigned information is available. Active learning is effective in complex topics, although its efficiency is limited due to the difficulties in text classification. The most promising criterion and weighting method are the same regardless of the review topic, and unsupervised techniques like LDA have a possibility to boost the performance of active learning without manual annotation.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs)are an important component to identify and aggregate research evidence from different empirical studies. One of the activities associated with the SLR process is the selection of primary studies. The process used to select primary studies can be arduous, particularly when the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies. Aim: An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and effectiveness of graduate students in selecting primary studies manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study. Method: The same experimental design and materials of the previous experiment were used in the current experiment. Result: The previous experiment revealed that VTM techniques can speed up the selection of primary studies and increase the number of studies correctly included/excluded (effectiveness). The results of the replication confirmed that studies are more rapidly selected using VTM. We observed that the level of experience in researching has a direct relationship with the effectiveness. Conclusion: VTM techniques have proven valuable in the selection of primary studies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 ACM. This paper introduces a test collection for evaluating the effectiveness of different methods used to retrieve research studies for inclusion in systematic reviews. Systematic reviews appraise and synthesise studies that meet specific inclusion criteria. Systematic reviews intended for a biomedical science audience use boolean queries with many, often complex, search clauses to retrieve studies; these are then manually screened to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. This process is expensive and time consuming. The development of systems that improve retrieval effectiveness will have an immediate impact by reducing the complexity and resources required for this process. Our test collection consists of approximately 26 million research studies extracted from the freely available MEDLINE database, 94 review (query) topics extracted from Cochrane systematic reviews, and corresponding relevance assessments. Tasks for which the collection can be used for information retrieval system evaluation are described and the use of the collection to evaluate common baselines within one such task is demonstrated. The test collection is available at https://github.com/ielab/SIGIR2017-PICO-Collection.},

abstract = {Systematic mapping provides an overview of a research area to assess the quantity of evidence existing on a topic of interest. In spite of its relevance, the establishment of consistent categories and classification of primary studies in these categories are manually conducted. Objective: We propose an approach, named SM-VTM (Systematic Mapping based on Visual Text Mining), to support categorization and classification stages in the systematic mapping using Visual Text Mining (VTM), aiming at reducing time and effort required in this process. Method: We established SM-VTM, selected a VTM tool and conducted a case study comparing results of two systematic mappings: one performed manually and another using our approach. Results: The results of both systematic mappings were very similar, showing the viability of SM-VTM. Furthermore, since our approach was applied using a tool, reduction of time and effort can be achieved. Conclusions: The application of VTM seems to be very relevant in the context of systematic mapping.},

abstract = {Background. Search and selection of primary studies in System-atic Literature Reviews (SLR) is labour intensive, and hard to repli-cate and update. Aims. We explore a machine learning approach to support semi-automated search and selection in SLRs to address these weaknesses. Method. We 1) train a classiier on an initial set of papers, 2) extend this set of papers by automated search and snowballing, 3) have the researcher validate the top paper, selected by the classiier, and 4) update the set of papers and iterate the process until a stopping criterion is met. Results. We demonstrate with a proof-of-concept tool that the proposed automated search and selection approach generates valid search strings and that the performance for subsets of primary studies can reduce the man-ual work by half. Conclusions. approach is promising and the demonstrated advantages include cost savings and replicability. next steps include further tool development and evaluate the approach on a complete SLR.},

abstract = {? 2015 ACM.Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question by interpreting the current pertinent literature. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort to the group of experts. Most of proposed works apply supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to infer exclusion and inclusion rules by observing a human screener. Unless, these techniques holds very little promise in study identification phase, because the rate of excluding citations erroneously still unreasonable. In this paper, we contribute to this line of works by proposing an alternative approach, not yet tested in this domain based on semantic rule-based classifiers. This approach involved applying a novel Hybrid Feature Selection Method (HFSM) within a Class Association Rules (CARs) algorithm. Experiments are conducted on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review. The obtained results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature.},

This task, when applied to multi-label data where each instance is associated with a set of labels, supports emerging applications. Although multi-label data usually exhibit label relations, label dependence has been little studied in feature selection. We proposed two multi-label feature selection algorithms that consider label relations. These methods were experimentally competitive with traditional approaches.

abstract = {Context: A systematic literature review(SLR) is a methodology used to find and aggregate all relevant studies about a specific research question or topic of interest. Most of the SLR processes are manually conducted. Automating these processes can reduce the workload and time consumed by human. Method: we use SLR as a methodology to survey the literature about the technologies used to automate SLR processes. Result: from the collected data we found many work done to automate the study selection process but there is no evidence about automation of the planning and reporting process. Most of the authors use machine learning classifiers to automate the study selection process. From our survey, there are processes that are similar to the SLR process for which there are automatic techniques to perform them. Conclusion: Because of these results, we concluded that there should be more research done on the planning, reporting, data extraction and synthesizing processes of SLR. {\textcopyright} 2005 - 2014 JATIT {\&} LLS.

The significant workload required and the subjectivity bias could affect results. Aim: semi-automate the selection process to reduce the amount of manual work needed and the consequent subjectivity bias. Method: extend and enrich the selection of primary studies using the existing technologies in the field of Linked Data and text mining. We define formally the selection process and we also develop a prototype that implements it. Finally, we conduct a case study that simulates the selection process of a systematic literature published in literature. Results: the process presented in this paper could reduce the work load of 20{\%} with respect to the work load needed in the fully manually selection, with a recall of 100{\%}. Conclusions: the extraction of knowledge from scientific studies through Linked Data and text mining techniques could be used in the selection phase of the systematic review process to reduce the work load and subjectivity bias.},

abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a means to synthesize relevant and high quality studies related to a specific topic or research questions. In general, a SLR has three phases, and the first one is the Primary Selection in which the selection of studies is usually performed manually reading title, abstract and keywords of each study. The number of published scientific studies has grown, increasing effort in carrying out this review. In this paper, we proposed two strategies to rank studies in decreasing order of importance, for a SLR, regarding the terms in the search string. These strategies are based on the Information Retrieval technique Vector Model. We implemented those strategies and conducted a case study to evaluate their applicability. As results, the second strategy presents 50{\%} of precision on a recall of 80{\%}. Among the contributions of this study, two strategies to rank relevant documents in a SLR, regarding the search string, were proposed and analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Identifying features and their relations (i.e., variation points) is crucial in the process of migrating single software systems to software product lines (SPL). Various approaches have been proposed to perform feature extraction automatically from different artifacts, for instance, feature location in legacy code. Usually such approaches a) omit variability information and b) rely on artifacts that reside in advanced phases of the development process, thus, being only of limited usefulness in the context of SPLs. In contrast, feature and variability extraction from natural language (NL) documents is more favorable, because a mapping to several other artifacts is usually established from the very beginning. In this paper, we provide a multi-dimensional overview of approaches for feature and variability extraction from NL documents by means of a systematic literature review (SLR). We selected 25 primary studies and carefully evaluated them regarding different aspects such as techniques used, tool support, or accuracy of the results. In a nutshell, our key insights are that i) standard NLP techniques are commonly used, ii) post-processing often includes clustering {\&} machine learning algorithms, iii) only in rare cases, the approaches support variability extraction, iv) tool support, apart from text pre-processing is often not available, and v) many approaches lack a comprehensive evaluation. Based on these observations, we derive future challenges, arguing that more effort need to be invested for making such approaches applicable in practice.},

abstract = {Background: Since the introduction of the systematic review process to Software Engineering in 2004, researchers have investigated a number of ways to mitigate the amount of effort and time taken to filter through large volumes of literature. Aim: This study aims to provide a critical analysis of text mining techniques used to support the citation screening stage of the systematic review process. Method: We critically re-reviewed papers included in a previous systematic review which addressed the use of text mining methods to support the screening of papers for inclusion in a review. The previous review did not provide a detailed analysis of the text mining methods used. We focus on the availability in the papers of information about the text mining methods employed, including the description and explanation of the methods, parameter settings, assessment of the appropriateness of their application given the size and dimensionality of the data used, performance on training, testing and validation data sets, and further information that may support the reproducibility of the included studies. Results: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB) and Committee of classifiers (Ensemble) are the most used classification algorithms. In all of the studies, features were represented with Bag-of-Words (BOW) using both binary features (28{\%}) and term frequency (66{\%}). Five studies experimented with n-grams with n between 2 and 4, but mostly the unigram was used. $\chi$2, information gain and tf-idf were the most commonly used feature selection techniques. Feature extraction was rarely used although LDA and topic modelling were used. Recall, precision, F and AUC were the most used metrics and cross validation was also well used. More than half of the studies used a corpus size of below 1,000 documents for their experiments while corpus size for around 80{\%} of the studies was 3,000 or fewer documents. The major common ground we found for comparing performance assessment based on independent replication of studies was the use of the same dataset but a sound performance comparison could not be established because the studies had little else in common. In most of the studies, insufficient information was reported to enable independent replication. The studies analysed generally did not include any discussion of the statistical appropriateness of the text mining method that they applied. In the case of applications of SVM, none of the studies report the number of support vectors that they found to indicate the complexity of the prediction engine that they use, making it impossible to judge the extent to which over-fitting might account for the good performance results. Conclusions: There is yet to be concrete evidence about the effectiveness of text mining algorithms regarding their use in the automation of citation screening in systematic reviews. The studies indicate that options are still being explored, but there is a need for better reporting as well as more explicit process details and access to datasets to facilitate study replication for evidence strengthening. In general, the reader often gets the impression that text mining algorithms were applied as magic tools in the reviewed papers, relying on default settings or default optimization of available machine learning toolboxes without an in-depth understanding of the statistical validity and appropriateness of such tools for text mining purposes.},

abstract = {Context: In order to preserve the value of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs), they should be frequently updated including new studies produced after the conduction of the reviews. However, most of SLRs are outdated and there is a lack of works that support the conduction of SLRs updates. Objective: The main goal of this paper is to report our experience in updating two of our SLRs. Method: To update these two SLRs, we used automated techniques based on VTM (Visual Text Mining) to guarantee the presence of relevant studies. Results: From our experience, some factors to satisfactorily update SLRs were identified: (i) to adopt software tools to support the updating process; (ii) to provide as much as possible information of previous SLR; (iii) to involve researchers from previous SLR; and (iv) to reuse protocol from preliminar SLR. Conclusions: Reported lessons learned can be used as a basis of knowledge to guide researchers when updating their SLRs.},

RQ1: based on VTM (Visual Text Mining); Moreover, VTM has also been beneficial to update SLRs [4] and an approach, called USR–VTM, was proposed and will be also explored in the context of this paper. Because of this, a summary of this approach is presented in next section.

RQ2:an experiment to compare the outcomes achieved using this approach to the ones using traditional (manual) approach; updating two
SLRs;

RQ3: Aiming to select the primary studies to be in fact included
in SLR1', two researchers performed independently ... A total of 23 studies (27.4{\%} of 84 studies) were considered to be further analyzed. After that, we used the techniques based on VTM... As mentioned previously, the 14 studies included in SLR1 are coloured in green, the 50 studies excluded in SLR1 are coloured in red, and the 23 studies to be analyzed are coloured in grey...

RQ4: to support the update of SLRs; The main advantage of USR–VTM is that the selection activity (classification of studies as included or excluded) is based on previous knowledge.

CQ1: an experience report on the use of our approach to update SLRs executed by SE researchers; Considering our experience with regard to both updates and other SLRs that we have updated in the last years, following, we discuss four main lessons learned

abstract = {— The growing number of scientific publications and the availability of information in online repositories enable researchers to discover, analyze and maintain an updated state of the art bibliography. Indeed, few works explore this scenario in order to support researchers on the literature review step. Literature reviewing comprises a fundamental part of the scientific writing, in which publications are evaluated and selected by relevance. Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research. Experiments showed good results on learning performance when using a hybrid approach, increasing testing performance in 12{\%}, achieving 89.05{\%} in accuracy when classifying a paper as relevant.},

@article{O’Mara-Eves2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying relevant studies in an unbiased way for inclusion in systematic reviews both complex and time consuming. Text mining has been offered as a potential solution: through automating some of the screening process, reviewer time can be saved. The evidence base around the use of text mining for screening has not yet been pulled together systematically; this systematic review fills that research gap. Focusing mainly on non-technical issues, the review aims to increase awareness of the potential of these technologies and promote further collaborative research between the computer science and systematic review communities.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMETHODS: Five research questions led our review: what is the state of the evidence base; how has workload reduction been evaluated; what are the purposes of semi-automation and how effective are they; how have key contextual problems of applying text mining to the systematic review field been addressed; and what challenges to implementation have emerged? We answered these questions using standard systematic review methods: systematic and exhaustive searching, quality-assured data extraction and a narrative synthesis to synthesise findings.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nRESULTS: The evidence base is active and diverse; there is almost no replication between studies or collaboration between research teams and, whilst it is difficult to establish any overall conclusions about best approaches, it is clear that efficiencies and reductions in workload are potentially achievable. On the whole, most suggested that a saving in workload of between 30{\%} and 70{\%} might be possible, though sometimes the saving in workload is accompanied by the loss of 5{\%} of relevant studies (i.e. a 95{\%} recall).$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Using text mining to prioritise the order in which items are screened should be considered safe and ready for use in 'live' reviews. The use of text mining as a 'second screener' may also be used cautiously. The use of text mining to eliminate studies automatically should be considered promising, but not yet fully proven. In highly technical/clinical areas, it may be used with a high degree of confidence; but more developmental and evaluative work is needed in other disciplines.},

abstract = {Creating systematic reviews is a painstaking task undertaken especially in domains where experimental results are the primary method to knowledge creation. For the review authors, analysing documents to extract relevant data is a demanding activity. To support the creation of systematic reviews, we have created DASyR-a semi-automatic document analysis system. DASyR is our solution to annotating published papers for the purpose of ontology population. For domains where dictionaries are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing, followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to extend the annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation domain. The reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies makes it a perfect domain to test on. We show the utility of DASyR through experimental results for different parameter values for the bootstrap procedure, evaluated in terms of annotator agreement, error rate, precision and recall.},

abstract = {Objectives: Data extraction from original study reports is a time-consuming, error-prone process in systematic review development. Information extraction (IE) systems have the potential to assist humans in the extraction task, however majority of IE systems were not designed to work on Portable Document Format (PDF) document, an important and common extraction source for systematic review. In a PDF document, narrative content is often mixed with publication metadata or semi-structured text, which add challenges to the underlining natural language processing algorithm. Our goal is to categorize PDF texts for strategic use by IE systems. Methods: We used an open-source tool to extract raw texts from a PDF document and developed a text classification algorithm that follows a multi-pass sieve framework to automatically classify PDF text snippets (for brevity, texts) into TITLE, ABSTRACT, BODYTEXT, SEMISTRUCTURE, and METADATA categories. To validate the algorithm, we developed a gold standard of PDF reports that were included in the development of previous systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration. In a two-step procedure, we evaluated (1) classification performance, and compared it with machine learning classifier, and (2) the effects of the algorithm on an IE system that extracts clinical outcome mentions. Results: The multi-pass sieve algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.6{\%}, which was 9.7{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) higher than the best performing machine learning classifier that used a logistic regression algorithm. F-measure improvements were observed in the classification of TITLE (+15.6{\%}), ABSTRACT (+54.2{\%}), BODYTEXT (+3.7{\%}), SEMISTRUCTURE (+34{\%}), and MEDADATA (+14.2{\%}). In addition, use of the algorithm to filter semi-structured texts and publication metadata improved performance of the outcome extraction system (F-measure +4.1{\%}, p = 0.002). It also reduced of number of sentences to be processed by 44.9{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001), which corresponds to a processing time reduction of 50{\%} (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The rule-based multi-pass sieve framework can be used effectively in categorizing texts extracted from PDF documents. Text classification is an important prerequisite step to leverage information extraction from PDF documents.},

abstract = {Systematic review, a form of evidence synthesis that critically appraises existing studies on the same topic and synthesizes study results, helps reduce the evidence gap. However, keeping the systematic review up-to-date is a great challenge partly due to the difficulty in interpreting the conclusion of a systematic review. A promising approach to this challenge is to make semantic representation of the claims made in both the systematic review and the included studies it synthesizes so that it's possible to automatically predict whether the conclusion of a systematic review changes given a new study. In this dissertation work, we developed a taxonomy to represent knowledge claims both in systematic review and its included studies with the goal of automatically updating a systematic review. We then developed machine learning models to automatically predict a synthesized claim from claims in individual studies.},

abstract = {The number of scientific publications is constantly increasing, and the results published on Empirical Software Engineering are growing even faster. Some software engineering publishers have began to collaborate with research groups to make available repositories of software engineering empirical data. However, these initiatives are limited due to issues related to the available search tools. As a result, many researchers in the area have adopted a semi-automated approach for performing searches for systematic reviews as a mean to extract empirical evidence from published material. This makes this activity labor intensive and error prone. In this paper, we argue that the use of techniques from information retrieval, as well as text mining, can support systematic reviews and improve the creation of repositories of SE empirical evidence.},

abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is an information-based process throughout which each stage must be carefully and systematically designed in planning phase. Important decisions need to be made about the various choices involved in the SLR planning phase. However, due to the necessarily comprehensive and rigorous nature of SLR, many researchers have difficulties in planning SLRs sufficiently and effectively. In recent decades, the use of text mining (TM) techniques has been introduced to facilitate SLR process, especially at conducting review phase to support the searching and selection of studies. However, so far, TM techniques have not been applied to support any activities during SLR planning phase. In this research, we proposed a method that apply Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) method to support decision-making activities within the SLR planning phase. This method also known as SLR Planning Based on Suffix Tree Clustering (SLRP-STC) method. It aims to help reviewers in three ways: 1) to extract research topics easily; 2) to better interpret extracted information; and 3) to quickly realize and refine a proposed search string that is poorly formulated or inappropriate. A case study was conducted by comparing the proposed method with manual approach. It is observed that the use of SLRP-STC method can improve the planning of SLR.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a structured way of conducting a review that can assist the researcher in analyzing the progress of a specific stream of research. Although there are a number of SLR guidelines proposed by existing researchers, there is still too little attention paid to the approach taken and the tools that could be applied throughout the SLR process. Therefore, this paper attempted to fill the gap by presenting the application of Data Analytics approach in the SLR with the utilization of data mining and text mining technique. It proposed a step-by-step procedure using data analytics approach, and recommended tools to be used in the SLR process. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, the authors selected a Master Data Management research domain as a case study. Based on this particular application, it can be concluded that this approach is a replicable, effective and output-based approach in conducting an SLR. It is hoped that other researchers would be able to replicate this approach in doing SLR for other research domains such as software engineering and information technology fields of study.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews require expert reviewers to manually screen thousands of citations in order to identify all relevant articles to the review. Active learning text classification is a supervised machine learning approach that has been shown to significantly reduce the manual annotation workload by semi-automating the citation screening process of systematic reviews. In this paper, we present a new topic detection method that induces an informative representation of studies, to improve the performance of the underlying active learner. Our proposed topic detection method uses a neural network-based vector space model to capture semantic similarities between documents. We firstly represent documents within the vector space, and cluster the documents into a predefined number of clusters. The centroids of the clusters are treated as latent topics. We then represent each document as a mixture of latent topics. For evaluation purposes, we employ the active learning strategy using both our novel topic detection method and a baseline topic model (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Results obtained demonstrate that our method is able to achieve a high sensitivity of eligible studies and a significantly reduced manual annotation cost when compared to the baseline method. This observation is consistent across two clinical and three public health reviews. The tool introduced in this work is available from https://nactem.ac.uk/pvtopic/.},

abstract = {Tools for automatic subject assignment help deal with scale and sustainability in creating and enriching metadata, establishing more connections across and between resources and enhancing consistency. Although some software vendors and experimental researchers claim the tools can replace manual subject indexing, hard scientific evidence of their performance in operating information environments is scarce. A major reason for this is that research is usually conducted in laboratory conditions, excluding the complexities of real-life systems and situations. The article reviews and discusses issues with existing evaluation approaches such as problems of aboutness and relevance assessments, implying the need to use more than a single “gold standard” method when evaluating indexing and retrieval, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework. The framework is informed by a systematic review of the literature on evaluation approaches: evaluating indexing quality directly through assessment by an evaluator or through comparison with a gold standard, evaluating the quality of computer-assisted indexing directly in the context of an indexing workflow, and evaluating indexing quality indirectly through analyzing retrieval performance.},

abstract = {Each example in a multi-label dataset is associated with multiple labels, which are often correlated. Learning from this data can be improved when dimensionality reduction tasks, such as feature selection, are applied. The standard approach for multi-label feature selection transforms the multi-label dataset into single-label datasets before using traditional feature selection algorithms. However, this approach often ignores label dependence. In this work, we propose an alternative method, LCFS, that constructs new labels based on relations between the original labels. By doing so, the label set from the data is augmented with second-order information before applying the standard approach. To assess LCFS, an experimental evaluation using Information Gain as a measure to estimate the importance of features was carried out on 10 benchmark multi-label datasets. This evaluation compared four LCFS settings with the standard approach, using random feature selection as a reference. For each dataset, the performance of a feature selection method is estimated by the quality of the classifiers built from the data described by the features selected by the method. The results show that a simple LCFS setting gave rise to classifiers similar to, or better than, the ones built using the standard approach. Furthermore, this work also pioneers the use of the systematic review method to survey the related work on multi-label feature selection. The summary of the 99 papers found promotes the idea that exploring label dependence during feature selection can lead to good results.},

abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a key tool for evidence-based practice as it combines results from multiple studies of a specific topic of research. Due its characteristics, it is a time consuming, hard process that requires a properly documented protocol for scientific acknowledgment. In this context, this paper presents the SESRA -- a web-based automated tool to support all phases of the SLR process, contributing to its productivity and reliability. We also present a use case on the software engineering field, applying specific knowledge to set the process in the discipline. Further, we discuss how to use the tool to establish a more formal and controlled process and to reduce effort on its repetitive activities. The outcomes and feedback obtained in early use have shown that SESRA could support the SLR process, automating some of its key activities.},

abstract = {Context: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are an important component to identify and aggregate research evidence from different empirical studies. Despite its relevance, most of the process is conducted manually, implying additional effort when the Selection Review task is performed and leading to reading all studies under analysis more than once. Objective: We propose an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques to assist the Selection Review task in SLR. It is implemented into a VTM tool (Revis), which is freely available for use. Method: We have selected and implemented appropriate visualization techniques into our approach and validated and demonstrated its usefulness in performing real SLRs. Results: The results have shown that employment of VTM techniques can successfully assist in the Selection Review task, speeding up the entire SLR process in comparison to the conventional approach. Conclusion: VTM techniques are valuable tools to be used in the context of selecting studies in the SLR process, prone to speed up some stages of SLRs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Objective Systematic Reviews (SRs) are utilized to summarize evidence from high quality studies and are considered the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting SRs can be time and labor intensive due to the high cost of article screening. In previous studies, we demonstrated utilizing established (lexical) article relationships to facilitate the identification of relevant articles in an efficient and effective manner. Here we propose to enhance article relationships with background semantic knowledge derived from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts and ontologies. Methods We developed a pipelined semantic concepts representation process to represent articles from an SR into an optimized and enriched semantic space of UMLS concepts. Throughout the process, we leveraged concepts and concept relations encoded in biomedical ontologies (SNOMED-CT and MeSH) within the UMLS framework to prompt concept features of each article. Article relationships (similarities) were established and represented as a semantic article network, which was readily applied to assist with the article screening process. We incorporated the concept of active learning to simulate an interactive article recommendation process, and evaluated the performance on 15 completed SRs. We used work saved over sampling at 95{\%} recall (WSS95) as the performance measure. Results We compared the WSS95 performance of our ontology-based semantic approach to existing lexical feature approaches and corpus-based semantic approaches, and found that we had better WSS95 in most SRs. We also had the highest average WSS95 of 43.81{\%} and the highest total WSS95 of 657.18{\%}. Conclusion We demonstrated using ontology-based semantics to facilitate the identification of relevant articles for SRs. Effective concepts and concept relations derived from UMLS ontologies can be utilized to establish article semantic relationships. Our approach provided a promising performance and can easily apply to any SR topics in the biomedical domain with generalizability.},

abstract = {Literature reviews can be time-consuming and tedious to complete. By cataloging and refactoring three state-of-the-art active learning techniques from evidence-based medicine and legal electronic discovery, this paper finds and implements FASTREAD, a faster technique for studying a large corpus of documents. This paper assesses FASTREAD using datasets generated from existing SE literature reviews (Hall, Wahono, Radjenovic, Kitchenham et al.). Compared to manual methods, FASTREAD lets researchers find 95{\%} relevant studies after reviewing an order of magnitude fewer papers. Compared to other state-of-the-art automatic methods, FASTREAD reviews 20-50{\%} fewer studies while finding same number of relevant primary studies in a systematic literature review.},
annote = {ok
RQ1: FASTREAD; Support vector machines (SVM) are a well-known and widely used classification technique; Active learning is a cost-aware machine learning algorithm where labels of training data can be acquired with certain costs; TfidfVectorizer in scikit-learn is utilized for the above preprocessing and featurization steps. Alternatives such as stemming, LDA [3], paragraph vectors [32] require further exploration and are scheduled in our future works. All 32 treatments use the same classifier– linear SVM from scikit-learn;

RQ2: three datasets are created reverse-engineering existing SLRs and being used in this study to simulate the process of excluding irrelevant studies; Our datasets are generated using information in the original SLR literature. Our candidate studies are retrieved by applying similar if not the same the search string from original SLR literature and search in IEEE Xplore;

RQ3: The performance of each algorithm is thus evaluated by its recall vs. studies reviewed curve; This performance metrics is suggested by [10, 11, 53] and best fits the objectives of excluding irrelevant studies problem; Table 2: Scott-Knott analysis for number of studies reviewed/ work saved over sampling to reach 95{\%} recall; In general, active learning techniques can reduce cost in primary study selections with a sacrifice of(say 5{\%}) recall; Our results and estimations suggest that FASTREAD can save more than 40{\%} ofthe effort (associated with the primary selection study phase ofa literature review) while retrieving 95{\%} ofthe “relevant” studies.

RQ4: selection; to reduce the effort required to exclude primary studies;

abstract = {Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort. Text classification is useful in determining the statistical significance level of association rules to reduce workload in the systematic review. Several approaches to generate a Rule set for rule based classifiers were proposed in the literature. In this paper, we show that statistic as well as semantic measures of a rule can be combined and effectively computed as a hybrid feature selection rule measure (HFSRM). Moreover, we propose a new algorithm called Rules7-hybrid feature selection (Rules7-HFSRM) by combining the classical algorithm Rules7 and the HFSRM and then used it on the systematic review problem. Our results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms in the systematic review context.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether SVM-based classifiers, which are trained on a combination of inclusion and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new systematic reviews. Methods: Test collections were built using the annotated reference files from 19 procedure and 4 drug systematic reviews. The classifiers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of included and commonly excluded articles and one with a combination of included and excluded articles. AUCs were used as evaluation metrics. Results: The AUCs of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and commonly excluded articles, were significantly higher than those of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and excluded articles. Conclusion: Automatic, high-quality article classifiers using machine learning could reduce the workload of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-specific data are scarce. In particular, when used as training data, a combination of included and commonly excluded articles is more helpful than a combination of included and excluded articles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Context: An enormous number of papers (more than 70,000) have been published in the area of Software Engineering (SE) since its inception in 1968. To better characterize and understand this massive research literature, there is a need for comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Objective: The objective of this study is to utilize automated citation and topic analysis to characterize the software engineering research literature over the years. While a few bibliometrics studies have appeared in the field of SE, this article aims to be the most comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Method: To achieve the above objective, we report in this paper a bibliometrics study with data collected from Scopus database consisting of over 70,000 articles. For thematic analysis, we used topic modeling to automatically generate the most probable topic distributions given the data.Results: We found that number of papers published per year has grown tremendously and currently 6000-7000 papers are published every year. At the same time, nearly half of the papers are not cited at all. Using text mining of articles titles, we found that currently the hot research topics in software engineering are: (1) web services, (2) mobile and cloud computing, (3) industrial (case) studies, (4) source code and (5) test generation. Finally, we found that a small share of large countries produce the majority of the papers in SE while small European countries are proportionally the most active in the area of SE, based on the number of papers.Conclusion: Due to large volumes of research in SE, we suggest using the automated analysis of bibliometrics as we have done in this paper. By picking out the most cited papers, we can present the land marks of SE and, with thematic analysis, we can characterize the entire field. This can be useful for students and other new comers to SE and for presenting our achievements to other disciplines. In particular, we see and report the value of such an analysis in situations where performing a full scale SLR is not feasible due to restrictions on time or to lack of exact research questions.},

abstract = {Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.},

RQ1: Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM 

RQ2: a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach; Previous findings reported by Malheiros et al. [10] show that the use of VTM reduces the time taken to perform the selection activity and also improves the number of papers correctly included or excluded in SLRs.

RQ3: time taken - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; 
effectiveness - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; Table 1
Our results showed that the time taken by students 1 and 2 to perform the study selection activity on the basis of reading the abstracts was 85 and 54 minutes respectively; and the time taken by students 3 and 4 to perform the same activity using the VTM approach was 30 and 58 minutes respectively. The performance of the students using the VTM appeared to be either equivalent to or better than that of the students using the manual method.

RQ4: to support the primary study selection activity

abstract = {Context Independent validation of published scientific results through study replication is a pre-condition for accepting the validity of such results. In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field. Objective In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility. Methods The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach. Results Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80{\%} of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27{\%} of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available. Conclusions The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced.},

abstract = {A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) identifies, evaluates, and synthesizes the literature available for a given topic. This generally requires a significant human workload and has subjectivity bias that could affect the results of such a review. Automated document classification can be a valuable tool for recommending the selection of studies. In this article, we propose an automated pre-selection approach based on text mining and semantic enrichment techniques. Each document is firstly processed by a named entity extractor. The DBpedia URIs coming from the entity linking process are used as external sources of information. Our system collects the bag of words of those sources and it adds them to the initial document. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier discriminates whether the enriched document belongs to the positive example set or not. We used an existing manually performed SLR as benchmark data set. We trained our system with different configurations of relevant documents and we tested the goodness of our approach with an empirical assessment. Results show a reduction of the manual workload of 18{\%} that a human researcher has to spend, while holding a remarkable 95{\%} of recall, important condition for the nature itself of SLRs. We measure the effect of the enrichment process to the precision of the classifier and we observed a gain up to 5{\%}.},

abstract = {Citation screening, an integral process within systematic reviews that identifies citations relevant to the underlying research question, is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. During the screening task, analysts manually assign a label to each citation, to designate whether a citation is eligible for inclusion in the review. Recently, several studies have explored the use of active learning in text classification to reduce the human workload involved in the screening task. However, existing approaches require a significant amount of manually labelled citations for the text classification to achieve a robust performance. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method that identifies relevant citations as early as possible in the screening process by exploiting the pairwise similarities between labelled and unlabelled citations to improve the classification performance without additional manual labelling effort. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that similar citations share the same label (e.g., if one citation should be included, then other similar citations should be included also). To calculate the similarity between labelled and unlabelled citations we investigate two different feature spaces, namely a bag-of-words and a spectral embedding based on the bag-of-words. The semi-supervised method propagates the classification codes of manually labelled citations to neighbouring unlabelled citations in the feature space. The automatically labelled citations are combined with the manually labelled citations to form an augmented training set. For evaluation purposes, we apply our method to reviews from clinical and public health. The results show that our semi-supervised method with label propagation achieves statistically significant improvements over two state-of-the-art active learning approaches across both clinical and public health reviews.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become an established methodology in software engineering (SE) research however they can be very time consuming and error prone. Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Text summarization has grew so uses such as Due to the enormous aggregate of information getting augmented on internet; it is challenging for the user to verve through altogether the information accessible on web. The large availability of internet content partakes constrained a broad research area in the extent of automatic text summarization contained by the Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially statistical machine learning communal. Terminated the bygone half a century, the defaulting has been addressed from numerous diverse standpoints, in erratic domains and using innumerable archetypes.

Particular auspicious slants that quintessence on unambiguous minutiae of the summarization are also deliberated. Exceptional consideration is ardent to involuntary assessment of summarization classifications, as forthcoming investigation on summarization is sturdily reliant over evolvement in this problem space.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing popularity of systematic literature reviews in Software Engineering, several researchers still indicate it as a costly and challenging process. Aiming at alleviating this costly process, we propose an iterative method to support the process of building the search string for a systematic review. This method uses Visual Text Mining techniques to support the researcher by suggesting new terms for the string. In order to do so, the method extracts relevant terms from studies selected by the researcher and displays them in a way that facilitate their visualization and supports building and refining the search string. In order to check the feasibility of this approach, we developed a tool that implements the proposed method. Interviews with researchers identified their difficulties in performing systematic reviews and captured their feedback with regards the use of the proposed method in a user study. The researchers indicated that this approach could be used to improve the process of building the search strings for systematic reviews. The study indicates that our approach can be used to facilitate the construction of the systematic literature review search string. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

Despite encouraging early results, a systematic review process can be time consuming and hard to conduct. Thus, tools that help on its planning or execution are needed. This article suggests the use of visual text mining (VTM) to aid systematic reviews. A feasibility study was conducted comparing the proposed approach with a manual process. We observed that VTM can contribute to systematic review and we propose a new strategy called VTM-Based systematic review.},

[Aim]: This paper proposes an approach to leverage on empirically evolved ontology to support automating key SLR activities. [Method]: First, we propose an ontology, SLRONT, built on SLR experiences and best practices as a groundwork to capture common terminologies and their relationships during SLR processes; second, we present an extended version of SLRONT, the COSONT and instantiate it with the knowledge and concepts extracted from structured abstracts. Case studies illustrate the details of applying it for supporting SLR steps. [Results]: Results show that through using COSONT, we acquire the same conclusion compared with sheer manual works, but the efforts involved is significantly reduced. [Conclusions]: The approach of using ontology could effectively and efficiently support the conducting of systematic literature review.},
