abstract = {The presentation of results from Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) is generally done using tables. Prior research suggests that results summarized in tables are often difficult for readers to understand. One alternative to improve results' comprehensibility is to use graphical representations. The aim of this work is twofold: first, to investigate whether graph representations result is better comprehensibility than tables when presenting SLR results; second, to investigate whether interpretation using graphs impacts on performance, as measured by the time consumed to analyse and understand the data. We selected an SLR published in the literature and used two different formats to represent its results - tables and graphs, in three different combinations: (i) table format only; (ii) graph format only; and (iii) a mixture of tables and graphs. We conducted an experiment that compared the performance and capability of experts in SLR, as well as doctoral and masters students, in analysing and understanding the results of the SLR, as presented in one of the three different forms. We were interested in examining whether there is difference between the performance of participants using tables and graphs. The graphical representation of SLR data led to a reduction in the time taken for its analysis, without any loss in data comprehensibility. For our sample the analysis of graphical data proved to be faster than the analysis of tabular data. However, we found no evidence of a difference in comprehensibility whether using tables, graphical format or a combination. Overall we argue that graphs are a suitable alternative to tables when it comes to representing the results of an SLR. {\&}copy; 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs)are an important component to identify and aggregate research evidence from different empirical studies. One of the activities associated with the SLR process is the selection of primary studies. The process used to select primary studies can be arduous, particularly when the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies. Aim: An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and effectiveness of graduate students in selecting primary studies manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study. Method: The same experimental design and materials of the previous experiment were used in the current experiment. Result: The previous experiment revealed that VTM techniques can speed up the selection of primary studies and increase the number of studies correctly included/excluded (effectiveness). The results of the replication confirmed that studies are more rapidly selected using VTM. We observed that the level of experience in researching has a direct relationship with the effectiveness. Conclusion: VTM techniques have proven valuable in the selection of primary studies.},

abstract = {Software Effort Estimation is key to the success of any project since all downstream activities such as planning, budgeting, developing and Monitoring cannot be executed without clarity on the scope of the activity that needs to be performed. This is a tertiary study that follows the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process as put forth by Kitchenham in her seminal paper, based on five criteria: estimation technique, estimation accuracy, type of dataset and independent variables used in empirical research on effort estimation. Our study covering 820 Primary Studies through 14 SLRs, shows that Software Effort Estimation studies focus more on statistical techniques and Machine Learning is taking precedence in comparison to the others; whereas Expert Judgement is preferred by the industry due to its intuitiveness. There is a need for models that are simple to understand and global, due to the distributed nature of software development. The studies are inconclusive about the accuracy benefits of using a within company dataset vs.external datasets. Machine learning techniques such FL and GA in combination with Analogy methods generate more accurate estimates. There is increasing consensus on the use of Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Median Magnitude of Relative Error (MdMRE) and Prediction Pred (25{\%}) as the accuracy metric. 78{\%} of the Primary Studies reported accuracy using MMRE. The best MMRE reported is in the range of 7 to 75. ISBSG (International Software Benchmarking Standards Group) and Desharnais datasets with 27{\%} and 17{\%} usage respectively are the most widely used datasets in empirical studies on effort estimation. Fewer than 20 independent variables account for more than 90{\%} impact of variables in empirical analysis on Software effort estimation.},

abstract = {Summary form only given. Cell division is one of the most fundamental processes of life where the mother cell completely reorganizes its shape to support the partitioning of genetic information and the formation of two identical daughter cells. During this morphological transformation a large number of essential proteins have to carry out their function at specific times and subcellular locations to complete the division successfully. To achieve a mechanistic understanding of cell division process a comprehensive computational framework that is able to quantitatively analyze the dynamics of cell shape and subcellular protein distributions in an integrated manner is therefore needed. The highly deformable cell shape during cell division and cell to cell variability make this a nontrivial challenge and a comprehensive 3D computational model is still missing in the state of the art. We fill this gap by developing a 3D+time (4D) computational model of the mitotic cell in order to standardize and integrate subcellular protein distributions and quantify their spatio-temporal dynamics. This has been achieved by combining techniques from multiple disciplines: calibrated fluorescence microscopy, image analysis, spatio-temporal registration, machine learning and computational modelling. This work has established the first comprehensive computational model for the dividing human cell to standardize, integrate and mine time resolved proteomic data. This also enables building a 4D protein atlas of the dividing human cell in order to perform the systematic mapping and mining of dynamic protein distributions.},

However, due to large vocabulary of the sign language, traditional one-layer HMM method is becoming limited with the increasing number of training samples. It is tardy when recognizing which cannot meet the real time requirement. In this paper, we present a multi-resolution feature extracting method and a reducing dimension method of Maximum Variance Criterion (MVC), which has better performance in Sign Language Recognition system than traditional reducing dimension methods of PCA or ICA. Our multilayer sign language recognition system increases the recognition accuracy by 3.42{\%}, as well as reduces the recognition time by 0.992 second in average, compared with traditional HMM based system. {\textcopyright}2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: The efficacy of tele health interventions for achieving comparable or improved clinical outcomes has not been established well. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of home tele health interventions for people with asthma. Methods: An electronic search was performed in three different databases (Medline, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register). English language articles were selected for inclusion if they met the following criteria: randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a receiving tele health care with receiving usual care, inclusion of patients with asthma of any level of severity, and evaluation of efficacy or quality of life. Results: A total of 24 articles met inclusion criteria and were assessed. The included studies investigated various types of telecommunications technology to support and deliver healthcare from a distance. Improvement in asthma symptoms, quality of life and self-care behaviors as well as reduction in hospitalizations and emergency department visits was observed in different studies. There was a high level of acceptance of using the tele health systems among both healthcare providers and individuals. However, no statistically significant difference between the groups was observed in most of included studies. Conclusions: Overall, home tele health interventions appear to enhance patient access to healthcare professionals. Tele health solutions for asthma care are feasible and well-accepted and increase self-management skills, but evidence for their effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes is not strong. More research is needed to assess the effects of the range of telemedicine technologies.},

abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a structured way of conducting a review of existing research works produced by the earlier researchers. The application of right data analysis technique during the SLR evaluation stage would give an insight to the researcher in achieving the SLR objective. This paper presents how descriptive analysis and text analysis can be applied to achieve one of the common SLR objectives which is to study the progress of specific research domain. These techniques have been demonstrated to synthesis the progress of Master Data Management research domain. Using descriptive analysis technique, this study has identified a trend of related literary works distribution by years, sources, and publication types. Meanwhile, text analysis shows the common terms and interest topics in the Master Data Management research which are 1) master data, 2) data quality, 3) business intelligence, 4) business process, 5) data integration, 6) big data, 7) data governance, 8) information governance, 9) data management and 10) product data. It is hoped that other researchers would be able to replicate these analysis techniques in performing SLR for other research domains.},

abstract = {Multi-label learning handles datasets where each instance is associated with multiple labels, which are often correlated. As other machine learning tasks, multi-label learning also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which can be mitigated by dimensionality reduction tasks, such as feature selection. The standard approach for multi-label feature selection transforms the multi-label dataset into single-label datasets before using traditional feature selection algorithms. However, this approach often ignores label dependence. This work proposes an alternative method, LCFS, which constructs new labels based on relations between the original labels to augment the label set of the original dataset. Afterwards, the augmented dataset is submitted to the standard multi-label feature selection approach. Experiments using Information Gain as a measure to evaluate features were carried out in 10 multi-label benchmark datasets. For each dataset, the quality of the features selected was assessed by the quality of the classifiers built using the features selected by the standard approach in the original dataset, as well as in the dataset constructed by four LCFS settings. The results show that setting LCFS with simple strategies using pairs of labels gives rise to better classifiers than the ones built using the standard approach in the original dataset. Moreover, these good results are accomplished when a small number of features are selected. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) has been developed for more than 70 years; in addition to the establishment of associations, training centers, consulting companies, and software suppliers, research projects as well as related outcomes from different sectors did enrich the accumulation of the literature. A plethora of studies could be found from the database: from the theoretical perspective, methodological issues and the combination of TRIZ and other tools were extensively discussed; practically, manufacturing as well as service sectors were the major playground for utilizing TRIZ to improve operational performance. However, it is concluded that a systematic review of previous studies is needed for understanding the progress of applying the TRIZ methodology in world and setting a research agenda for the future. Based on statistical analysis and the results of text/data mining, the current study concluded that the most adapted tools in TRIZ are contradiction and patent analysis; furthermore, quality function deployment (QFD) and green design are the most popular methods used in combination with TRIZ.},

abstract = {Systematic studies of the literature can be done in different ways. In particular, different guidelines propose different first steps in their recommendations, e.g. start with search strings in different databases or start with the reference lists of a starting set of papers. In software engineering, the main recommended first step is using search strings in a number of databases, while in information systems, snowballing has been recommended as the first step. This paper compares the two different search approaches for conducting literature review studies. The comparison is conducted by searching for articles addressing "Agile practices in global software engineering". The focus of the paper is on evaluating the two different search approaches. Despite the differences in the included papers, the conclusions and the patterns found in both studies are quite similar. The strengths and weaknesses of each first step are discussed separately and in comparison with each other. It is concluded that none of the first steps is outperforming the other, and the choice of guideline to follow, and hence the first step, may be context-specific, i.e. depending on the area of study.

abstract = {Background: a systematic review identifies, evaluates and synthesizes the available literature on a given topic using scientific and repeatable methodologies. The significant workload required and the subjectivity bias could affect results. Aim: semi-automate the selection process to reduce the amount of manual work needed and the consequent subjectivity bias. Method: extend and enrich the selection of primary studies using the existing technologies in the field of Linked Data and text mining. We define formally the selection process and we also develop a prototype that implements it. Finally, we conduct a case study that simulates the selection process of a systematic literature published in literature. Results: the process presented in this paper could reduce the work load of 20{\%} with respect to the work load needed in the fully manually selection, with a recall of 100{\%}. Conclusions: the extraction of knowledge from scientific studies through Linked Data and text mining techniques could be used in the selection phase of the systematic review process to reduce the work load and subjectivity bias.},

abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a means to synthesize relevant and high quality studies related to a specific topic or research questions. In general, a SLR has three phases, and the first one is the Primary Selection in which the selection of studies is usually performed manually reading title, abstract and keywords of each study. The number of published scientific studies has grown, increasing effort in carrying out this review. In this paper, we proposed two strategies to rank studies in decreasing order of importance, for a SLR, regarding the terms in the search string. These strategies are based on the Information Retrieval technique Vector Model. We implemented those strategies and conducted a case study to evaluate their applicability. As results, the second strategy presents 50{\%} of precision on a recall of 80{\%}. Among the contributions of this study, two strategies to rank relevant documents in a SLR, regarding the search string, were proposed and analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {—Demand-side management technology is a key ele-ment of the proposed smart grid, which will help utilities make more efficient use of their generation assets by reducing con-sumers' energy demand during peak load periods. However, although some modern appliances can respond to price signals from the utility companies, there is a vast stock of older appli-ances that cannot. For such appliances, utilities must infer what appliances are operating in a home, given only the power signals on the main feeder to the home (i.e., the home's power con-sumption must be disaggregated into individual appliances). We report on an in-depth investigation of multi-label classification algorithms for disaggregating appliances in a power signal. A sys-tematic review of this research topic shows that this class of algo-rithms has received little attention in the literature, even though it is arguably a more natural fit to the disaggregation problem than the traditional single-label classifiers used to date. We exam-ine a multi-label meta-classification framework (RAkEL), and a bespoke multi-label classification algorithm (MLkNN), employ-ing both time-domain and wavelet-domain feature sets. We test these classifiers on two real houses from the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset. We found that the multilabel algorithms are effective and competitive with published results on the datasets.},

abstract = {Sequential pattern matching and retrieving is of real value. For example, finding stocks in the NASDAQ market whose closing prices are always about {\$}\beta₀ higher than or \beta₁ times as that of a given company. The probelm reduces to linear pattern retrieval: given query X, find all sequence Y from database S so that Y = \beta₀ + \beta₁ with confidence C. In this paper, we novelly introduce SLR (Simple Linear Regression) model [5,7] to solve this problem. We extend 1-dimensional R{\^{}}2 to ER{\^{}}2 for multi-dimensional sequence matching, such as on-line handwritten signature. In addition, we develop SLR+FFT pruning techniques based on SLR to speed up retrieval without incurring any false dismissal. Experimental results show that the pruning ratio of SLR+FFT is efficient (can be above 99{\%}). Experiments on real stocks discovered many interesting patterns. Preliminary test on on-line signature recognition using ER{\^{}}2 as similarity measure also shows high accuracy.},

abstract = {Background Many therapies are commonly used to help treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. However, there is a lack of direct evidence to help the clinicians make a decision. Objectives The aim of this review is to determine whether one of the approaches is more benefit than any of the others for the treatment of IBS through adjusted indirect comparison. Methods We searched the Cochrane Library (from inception to March 2014) using the keyword “irritable bowel syndrome” for systematic reviews. According to the pre-specified selection criteria, qualified trials were selected from the identified reviews. We calculated pooled random- or fixed-effects estimates according to the type of treatment for the proportions of treatment response. Adjusted indirect comparison was used for the pooled RRs of any two types of treatments with placebo as the common control. The primary outcome was improvement of patients global assessment. The second outcome included the improvement of IBS-symptom score and improvement of symptoms of abdominal pain. Results Nine systematic reviews were identified including 203 trials. Ultimately, 62 studies (N= 11,326) fulfilled inclusion criteria. For primary outcome global assessment, herbal medicine was associated with greater effects than western active medicine (RR, 1.34 [95{\%}CI, 1.03-1.75]). For secondary outcome, the adjusted indirect comparison showed that there was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and western active medicine in symptom severity. Herbal medicine may possibly be more effective than western active medicine in reducing abdominal pain, although the wide confidence intervals preclude any definite conclusions, with a RR of 1.18 [95{\%}CI, 0.65-2.15]. Conclusions Herbal medicine may be more effective than western active medicine for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, especially in relieving the global symptoms, which may help t- e clinicians to make a decision in routine practice.},

abstract = {—To uncover interesting and actionable information from natural language documents authored by software develop-ers, many researchers rely on " out-of-the-box " NLP libraries. However, software artifacts written in natural language are different from other textual documents due to the technical language used. In this paper, we first analyze the state of the art through a systematic literature review in which we find that only a s›mall minority of papers justify their choice of an NLP library. We then report on a series of experiments in which we applied four state-of-the-art NLP libraries to publicly available software artifacts from three different sources. Our results show low agreement between different libraries (only between 60{\%} and 71{\%} of tokens were assigned the same part-of-speech tag by all four libraries) as well as differences in accuracy depending on source: For example, spaCy achieved the best accuracy on Stack Overflow data with nearly 90{\%} of tokens tagged correctly, while it was clearly outperformed by Google's SyntaxNet when parsing GitHub ReadMe files. Our work implies that researchers should make an informed decision about the particular NLP library they choose and that customizations to libraries might be necessary to achieve good results when analyzing software artifacts written in natural language.},

abstract = {— The growing number of scientific publications and the availability of information in online repositories enable researchers to discover, analyze and maintain an updated state of the art bibliography. Indeed, few works explore this scenario in order to support researchers on the literature review step. Literature reviewing comprises a fundamental part of the scientific writing, in which publications are evaluated and selected by relevance. Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research. Experiments showed good results on learning performance when using a hybrid approach, increasing testing performance in 12{\%}, achieving 89.05{\%} in accuracy when classifying a paper as relevant.},

Many researchers have discussed important factors in knowledge sharing. Nevertheless, the success rate for ISD projects is low and there are other major factors for consideration. Review was conducted to identify potential gaps in existing literature and to explore new factors that impact ISD knowledge sharing in RE. Based on systematic review of literature, two new factors are identified namely Organizational Justice and Social Interdependence. The success of ISD projects are impacted by organizational justice and social interdependence. The proposed theoretical model provides project managers a new platform to further understand ISD knowledge sharing between business users and external IT professionals in RE.},

abstract = {—Deep architectures with convolution structure have been found highly effective and commonly used in computer vision. With the introduction of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for general purpose issues, there has been an increasing attention towards exploiting GPU processing power for deep learning algorithms. Also, large amount of data online has made possible to train deep neural networks efficiently. The aim of this paper is to perform a systematic mapping study, in order to investigate existing research about implementations of computer vision approaches based on deep learning algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We selected a total of 119 papers, which were classified according to field of interest, network type, learning paradigm, research and contribution type. Our study demonstrates that this field is a promising area for research. We choose human pose estimation in video frames as a possible computer vision task to explore in our research. After careful studying we propose three different research direction related to: improving existing CNN implementations, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for human pose estimation and finally relying on unsupervised learning paradigm to train NNs.},

abstract = {Creating systematic reviews is a painstaking task undertaken especially in domains where experimental results are the primary method to knowledge creation. For the review authors, analysing documents to extract relevant data is a demanding activity. To support the creation of systematic reviews, we have created DASyR-a semi-automatic document analysis system. DASyR is our solution to annotating published papers for the purpose of ontology population. For domains where dictionaries are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing, followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to extend the annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation domain. The reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies makes it a perfect domain to test on. We show the utility of DASyR through experimental results for different parameter values for the bootstrap procedure, evaluated in terms of annotator agreement, error rate, precision and recall.},

In this research, we propose to leverage advanced analytics techniques for automatically classifying articles for inclusion and exclusion for systematic review update. Specifically, we used the soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier and examined various techniques to resolve class imbalance issues. Through an empirical study, we demonstrated that the soft-margin SVM works better than the perceptron algorithm used in current research and the performance of the classifier can be further improved by exploiting different sampling methods to resolve class imbalance issues.},

abstract = {While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have focused on discovering genetic loci mapped to a disease, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies combine microarray data and provide a powerful approach. Microarrays allow one to measure thousands of gene expressions simultaneously and the advances in eQTL studies enable one to capture the insight of the genetic architecture of gene expression. A number of multivariate methods have been recently proposed to identify genetic loci which are linked to gene expression taking into account joint effects and relationships between the units rather than the single locus alone independently. However, the previous research has limitations, such as the lack of supporting the cis/tran-eQTL model into being accepted as a general genetics model. We propose a novel regularized eQTL association mapping detection (Reg-AMADE) method. We have focused on the following three problems. First, we need to take into account co-expressed genes without using clustering or partitioning techniques, as well as detecting linkage disequilibrium and the joint effect of multiple genetic markers. Secondly, we need to build a regularized model to support the cis- and trans-eQTL model observed in most association studies. Lastly, we need to discover the significant genes underlying within diseases rather than a common component. We also propose a new simulation experiment method that implements practical situations so that the results can be evaluated in the true sense instead of the assessment with random samples generated from multivariate normal distributions that most research has mainly used. The power to detect both the joint effect and grouping effect of SNPs and gene expressions is assessed in the simulation study.},

These communities have the potential to influence patients' health behaviors and increase their engagement with therapies. However, the interaction dynamics in this type of media remains poorly understood what might hinder the development of strategies that facilitate and encourage participation. Social Network Analysis is a technique that tries to expose the hidden channels of communication and information flow, leading to a better understanding of how members relate to each other on online social network. In this study we do a systematic review of the literature regarding the apply this technique in the study of online health communities. We show that this type of studies is scarce and that, in this domain, Social Network Analysis is mainly applied to identify influential key members, as well as the most active members in terms of posting or answering questions.},

Some software engineering publishers have began to collaborate with research groups to make available repositories of software engineering empirical data. However, these initiatives are limited due to issues related to the available search tools. As a result, many researchers in the area have adopted a semi-automated approach for performing searches for systematic reviews as a mean to extract empirical evidence from published material. This makes this activity labor intensive and error prone. In this paper, we argue that the use of techniques from information retrieval, as well as text mining, can support systematic reviews and improve the creation of repositories of SE empirical evidence.},

abstract = {Remote sensing image segmentation requiresmulti-category classification typically with limited number of labeled training samples. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a sub-field of machine learning to tackle the scarcity of labeled samples, most SSL algorithms to date have had trade-offs in terms of scalability and/or applicability to multi-categorical data. In this paper, we evaluate semi-supervised logistic regression (SLR), a recent information theoretic semi-supervised algorithm, for remote sensing image classification problems. SLR is a probabilistic discriminative classifier and a specific instance of the generalizedmaximumentropy framework with a convex loss function. Moreover, the method is inherently multi-class and easy to implement. These characteristics make SLR a strong alternative to the widely used semi-supervised variants of SVMfor the segmentation of remote sensing images. We demonstrate the competitiveness of SLR in multispectral, hyperspectral and radar image classification. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

Due to significant variation points in previous studies, results are not easily aggregated. Aim. We aim at an overview picture of the outcome of previous evaluations. Method. Based on a systematic mapping study, we perform a synthesis of published research. Results. Our synthesis shows that there are no empirical evidence that any IR model outperforms another model consistently. We also display a strong dependency between the Precision and Recall (P-R) values and the input datasets. Finally, our mapping of P-R values on the possible output space highlights the difficulty of recovering accurate trace links using naïve cut-off strategies. Conclusion. Based on our findings, we stress the need for empirical evaluations beyond the basic P-R 'race'.},

abstract = {Adequate grasping force estimation and slip detection is a vital problem in wider applications of robots and manipulators in industries as well as in our everyday life. In this paper, a new methodology for slip detection during grasping by robot grippers/end-effectors using tactile sensor has been presented. During the object slippage, the tactile sensor in touch with the object surface travels along the peaks and valleys of surface texture of the object which creates vibratory motions in the tactile. A newly developed mathematical model is used to compute the scattered energy of vibrations, which contains parameters of surface texture geometry as well as trial grasping force, and other relevant parameters. Using the scattered energy of vibrations predicted by soft computing techniques, an attempt to instantly estimate the adequate grasping force has been reasonably successful. Surface texture data, for experimental estimation of grasping force, were collected from a huge number of machined specimens and were used to build four different machine learning estimation techniques. Experimental results using Linear Regression (LR), Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Pace Regression (PR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrate a relatively better technique for industrial applications.},

Segmentation of the hand part from the other body parts and background is the primary need of any hand gesture based application system; but gesture recognition systems are often plagued by different segmentation problems, and by the ones like co-articulation, movement epenthesis, recognition of similar gestures etc. The principal objective of this paper is to address a few of the said problems. In this paper, we propose a method for recognizing isolated as well as continuous English alphabet gestures which is a step towards helping and educating the hearing and speech-impaired people. We have performed the classification of the gestures with artificial neural network. Recognition rate (RR) of the isolated gestures is found to be 92.50{\%} while that of continuous gestures is 89.05{\%} with multilayer perceptron and 87.14{\%} with focused time delay neural network. These results, when compared with other such system in the literature, go into showing the effectiveness of the system. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Research into cyberbullying detection has increased in recent years, due in part to the proliferation of cyberbullying across social media and its detrimental effect on young people. A growing body of work is emerging on automated approaches to cyberbullying detection. These approaches utilise machine learning and natural language processing techniques to identify the characteristics of a cyberbullying exchange and automatically detect cyberbullying by matching textual data to the identified traits. In this paper, we present a systematic review of published research (as identified via Scopus, ACM and IEEE Xplore bibliographic databases) on cyberbullying detection approaches. On the basis of our extensive literature review, we categorise existing approaches into 4 main classes, namely; supervised learning, lexicon based, rule based and mixed-initiative approaches. Supervised learning-based approaches typically use classifiers such as SVM and Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes to develop predictive models for cyberbullying detection. Lexicon based systems utilise word lists and use the presence of words within the lists to detect cyberbullying. Rules-based approaches match text to predefined rules to identify bullying and mixed-initiatives approaches combine human-based reasoning with one or more of the aforementioned approaches. We found lack of quality representative labelled datasets and non-holistic consideration of cyberbullying by researchers when developing detection systems are two key challenges facing cyberbullying detection research. This paper essentially maps out the state-of-the-art in cyberbullying detection research and serves as a resource for researchers to determine where to best direct their future research efforts in this field.},

abstract = {After a systematic review on psychological and neurophysiological studies, we propose a computational cognitive model for Chinese Sign Language (CSL) perception and comprehension with detailed algorithmic descriptions based on cognitive functionalities in human language processing. A semantic neural network based on this model is introduced as the knowledge representation method in CSL comprehension. In line with the actual attention of the deaf, a revised game theory is presented by assigning attention. This paper illustrates the applications of the proposed model in classifier predicative comprehension of CSL. After the spreading activation process, each handshape node is assigned with appropriate values that depend on the relationships nodes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively improve the performance of handshape associative memory.},

abstract = {Sign Language Recognition (SLR) aims at translating the Sign Language (SL) into speech or text, so as to facilitate the communication between hearing-impaired people and the normal people. This problem has broad social impact, however it is challenging due to the variation for different people and the complexity in sign words. Traditional methods for SLR generally use handcrafted feature and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) modeling temporal information. But reliable handcrafted features are difficult to design and not able to adapt to the large variations of sign words. To approach this problem, considering that Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) can model the contextual information of temporal sequence well, we propose an end-to-end method for SLR based on LSTM. Our system takes the moving trajectories of 4 skeleton joints as inputs without any prior knowledge and is free of explicit feature design. To evaluate our proposed model, we built a large isolated Chinese sign language vocabulary with Kinect 2.0. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional HMM based methods.},

abstract = {The Sign Language Recognition (SLR) Problem is a highly important research topic, because of its ability to increase the interaction between the people who are hearing-impaired or impediment in speech. We propose a simple but robust system. The proposed system consists of three main steps. First we apply segmentation to the face and hand region by using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) and Thresholding. FCM is a clustering technique which employs fuzzy partitioning, in an iterative algorithm. After the face and hands are segmented, the feature vectors are extracted. The feature vectors are chosen among the low level features such as the bounding ellipse, bounding box, and center of mass coordinates, since they are known to be more robust to segmentation errors due to low resolution images. In total there are 23 features for each hand. After the feature vectors are extracted, they are used for recognition with discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Recognition stage is composed of two stages, namely training and classification. The Baum Welch algorithm is used for HMM training. In classification part the likelihood of each HMM is calculated and the HMM with the highest likelihood is chosen. In order to measure the success rate of the system, the eNTERFACE dataset is used. In this dataset 8 different American Sign Language example classified and in user independent case, is shown to be working with 94.19{\%} accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Objective Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder in primary care. The clinical studies on anxiety disorders have been commonly conducted, however the efficacy of acupuncture in treating GAD is uncertain. We therefore performed a systematic review to evaluate the evidence regarding acupuncture for GAD. Data Sources CBM, CAJ, CSJD, CNKI, WanFang, EMBASE, Pubmed/MEDLINE, OVID EBM Reviewers, Cochrane Library, Up-to-date, ACP journal club were searched through July 2016. Search terms included Condition = (Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Generalized Anxiety or GAD) And Intervention = (acupuncture* or acupressure or acupoint* or electro acupuncture* or electro-acupuncture*). Study Selection Included in this study were randomized controlled trials of participants have GAD diagnosed by operational criteria. Data Extraction Two review authors extracted data from each study independently. Information relating to study population, sample size, interventions, comparators, potential biases in the conduct of the trial, outcomes including adverse events, follow-up and methods of statistical analysis were abstracted from the original reports. Data Synthesis 3 RCTs (443 patients) were included. Overall the risk of bias in included studies was high. The included trials were extremely heterogeneous regarding acupuncture and control interventions. Therefore, pooling of data was not performed. We found equal benefits of acupuncture and medications for HAMA or SAS in 2 trials. In another trail no difference was found in the baseline analysis with HAMA and SAS measurement between groups at the2nd, 4thweek time-point. Adverse events associated with acupuncture are rarely reported. Conclusion Even though some methodological shortcomings influence the quality of the included studies, this review still suggests that acupuncture was an effective alternative therapy for generalized anxiety is safe.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the recent progress of remote sensing image scene classification, proposes a large-scale benchmark dataset, and evaluates a number of state-of-the-art methods using the proposed dataset. Abstract—Remote sensing image scene classification plays an important role in a wide range of applications and hence has been receiving remarkable attention. During the past years, significant efforts have been made to develop various datasets or present a variety of approaches for scene classification from remote sensing images. However, a systematic review of the literature concerning datasets and methods for scene classification is still lacking. In addition, almost all existing datasets have a number of limitations, including the small scale of scene classes and the image numbers, the lack of image variations and diversity, and the saturation of accuracy. These limitations severely limit the development of new approaches especially deep learning-based methods. This paper first provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress. Then, we propose a large-scale dataset, termed "NWPU-RESISC45", which is a publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This dataset contains 31,500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. The proposed NWPU-RESISC45 (i) is large-scale on the scene classes and the total image number, (ii) holds big variations in translation, spatial resolution, viewpoint, object pose, illumination, background, and occlusion, and (iii) has high within-class diversity and between-class similarity. The creation of this dataset will enable the community to develop and evaluate various data-driven algorithms. Finally, several representative methods are evaluated using the proposed dataset and the results are reported as a useful baseline for future research.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a hybrid algorithm combining support vector regression with evolutionary strategy (SVR-ES) in order to build successful predictive models for downscaling problems. SVR-ES uses uncorrelated mutation with p step sizes to find the optimal SVR hyper-parameters. Two downscaling forecast problems used in the WCCI-2006 contest - surface air temperature and precipitation - were tested. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) as benchmark and a variety of machine learning techniques including bootstrap-aggregated ensemble artificial neural network (ANN), SVR with hyper-parameters given by the Cherkassky-Ma estimate and random forest (RF). We also tested all techniques with using stepwise linear regression (SLR) first to screen out irrelevant predictors. We concluded that SVR-ES is an attractive approach because it tends to outperform the other techniques and can also be implemented in an almost automatic way. The Cherkassky-Ma estimate is a useful approach to minimizing the MAE error and also saves computational time related to the hyper-parameter search. The ANN and RF are also good options to outperform multiple linear regression (MLR). Finally, the use of SLR for predictor selection can dramatically reduce computational time and often help to enhance accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Missing Values (MV) present a serious problem facing research in software engineering (SE) which is mainly based on statistical and/or data mining analysis of SE data. The simple method of dealing with MV is to ignore data with missing observations. This leads to losing valuable information and then obtaining biased results. Therefore, various techniques have been developed to deal adequately with MV, especially those based on imputation methods. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was carried out to summarize the existing techniques dealing with MV in SE datasets and to classify the selected studies according to six classification criteria: research type, research approach, MV technique, MV type, data types and MV objective. Publication channels and trends were also identified. As results, 35 papers concerning MV treatments of SE data were selected. This study shows an increasing interest in machine learning (ML) techniques especially the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) to deal with MV in SE datasets and found that most of the MV techniques are used to serve software development effort estimation techniques.},

abstract = {The performance of spoken language recognition system is typically formulated to reflect the detection cost and the strategic decision points along the detection-error-tradeoff curve. We propose a performance metrics optimization (PMO) approach to optimizing the detection performance of Gaussian mixture model classifiers. We design the objective functions to directly relate the model parameters to the performance metrics of interest, i.e., the detection cost function and the area under the detection-error-tradeoff curve. Both metrics are approximated by differentiable functions of model parameters. In this way, the model parameters can be optimized with the generalized probabilistic descent algorithm, a typical discriminative training technique. We conduct the experiments on the NIST 2003 and 2005 Language Recognition Evaluation corpora. The experimental results show that the PMO approach effectively improves the performance over the maximum-likelihood training approach.},

abstract = {We describe a prototype for a hybrid system designed to reduce the number of citations needed to re-screen (NNRS) by systematic reviewers, where citations include titles, abstracts, and metadata. The system obviates the need for screening the entire set of citations a second time, which is typically done to control human error. The reference set is based on a complex review about organ transplantation (N=10,796 citations). Data were split into 50{\%} training and test sets, randomly stratified for percentage eligible citations. The system consists of a rule-based module and a machine-learning (ML) module. The former substantially reduces the number of negative citations passed to the ML module and improves imbalance. Relative to the baseline, the system reduces classification error (5.6{\%} vs 2.9{\%}) thereby reducing NNRS by 47.3{\%} (300 vs 158). We discuss the implications of de-emphasizing sensitivity (recall) in favor of specificity and negative predictive value to reduce screening burden.},

abstract = {Across neuroscience research, clinical diagnostics, and engineering applications in pain evaluation and treatment, there is a need for an objective measure of pain experience and detection when it occurs. This detector should be reliable in real-world settings using easily accessible, non-invasive data sources. We present a simple yet robust paradigm for decoding pain using neural and physiological data including electroencephalography (EEG), pulse, and skin conductance (GSR) measurements. The present study uses multivariate classification to distinguish painful events from non-painful multimodal sensory stimuli. To classify the pain response and detect relevant data attributes, we employed a sparse logistic regression (SLR) machine learning protocol with automatic feature selection. EEG input consisted of time-frequency changes under trial conditions, and physiological data included fluctuations and spikes in pulse and skin conductance. Classification averaged 70{\%} accuracy and selected between 5 and 15 features. In our experiment, pain was induced by cold stimulation which became noxious with prolonged exposure. Due to the long, ramp-and-hold nature of the stimulus, along with individual variability in sensitivity to pain, we did not observe specific rapid evoked responses or time-locked events common across participants. However, this format more closely resembles the experience of pain conditions requiring intervention which could be facilitated by a decoding system. The results illustrate the feasibility of developing a wireless pain detection system and give insight to important temporal, spectral, and spatial EEG events and physiological indicators of pain states. Success of the classifier protocol using these parameters could lead to the creation of a closed-loop system for decoding and intervention which can be applied in engineering and medical contexts.},

abstract = {This paper presents a supervised learning approach to support the screening of HIV literature. The manual screening of biomedical literature is an important task in the process of systematic reviews. Researchers and curators have the very demanding, time-consuming and error-prone task of manually identifying documents that must be included in a systematic review concerning a specific problem. We implemented a supervised learning approach to support screening tasks, by automatically flagging potentially selected documents in a list retrieved by a literature database search. To overcome the main issues associated with the automatic literature screening task, we evaluated the use of data sampling, feature combinations, and feature selection methods, generating a total of 105 classification models. The models yielding best results were composed by the Logistic Model Trees classifier, a fairly balanced training set, and feature combination of Bag-Of-Words and MeSH terms. According to our results, the system correctly labels the great majority of relevant documents, and it could be used to support HIV systematic reviews to allow researchers to assess a greater number of documents in less time. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Sparsity-based approaches have been popular in many applications in image processing and imaging. Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images in a transform domain or dictionary to improve image recovery from undersampled measurements. In the context of inverse problems in dynamic imaging, recent research has demonstrated the promise of sparsity and low-rank techniques. For example, the patches of the underlying data are modeled as sparse in an adaptive dictionary domain, and the resulting image and dictionary estimation from undersampled measurements is called dictionary-blind compressed sensing, or the dynamic image sequence is modeled as a sum of low-rank and sparse (in some transform domain) components (L+S model) that are estimated from limited measurements. In this work, we investigate a data-adaptive extension of the L+S model, dubbed LASSI, where the temporal image sequence is decomposed into a low-rank component and a component whose spatiotemporal (3D) patches are sparse in some adaptive dictionary domain. We investigate various formulations and efficient methods for jointly estimating the underlying dynamic signal components and the spatiotemporal dictionary from limited measurements. We also obtain efficient sparsity penalized dictionary-blind compressed sensing methods as special cases of our LASSI algorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of LASSI schemes for dynamic magnetic resonance image reconstruction from limited k-t space data compared to recent methods such as k-t SLR and L+S, and compared to the proposed dictionary-blind compressed sensing method.},

abstract = {Content-based multimedia retrieval (CBMR) has been an active research domain since the mid 1990s. In medicine visual retrieval started later and has mostly remained a research instrument and less a clinical tool. The limited size of data sets due to privacy constraints is often mentioned as reason for these limitations. Nevertheless, much work has been done in CBMR, including the availability of increasingly large data sets and scientific challenges. Annotated data sets and clinical data for images have now become available and can be combined for multi-modal retrieval. Much has been learned on user behavior and application scenarios. This text is motivated by the advances in medical image analysis and the availability of public large data sets that often include clinical data. It is a systematic review of recent work (concentrating on the period 2011-2017) on multi-modal CBMR and image understanding in the medical domain, where image understanding includes techniques such as detection, localization, and classification for leveraging visual content. With the objective of summarizing the current state of research for multimedia researchers outside the medical field, the text provides ways to get data sets and identifies current limitations and promising research directions. The text highlights advances in the past six years and a trend to use larger scale training data and deep learning approaches that can replace/complement hand-crafted features. Using images alone will likely only work in limited domains but combining multiple sources of data for multi-modal retrieval has the biggest chances of success, particularly for clinical impact.},

abstract = {Spam is information crafted to be delivered to a large number of recipients, in spite of their wishes. A spam filter is an automated tool to recognize spam so as to prevent its delivery. The purposes of spam and spam filters are diametrically opposed: spam is effective if it evades filters, while a filter is effective if it recognizes spam. The circular nature of these definitions, along with their appeal to the intent of sender and recipient make them difficult to formalize. A typical email user has a working definition no more formal than "I know it when I see it." Yet, current spam filters are remarkably effective, more effective than might be expected given the level of uncertainty and debate over a formal definition of spam, more effective than might be expected given the state-of-the-art information retrieval and machine learning methods for seemingly similar problems. But are they effective enough? Which are better? How might they be improved? Will their effectiveness be compromised by more cleverly crafted spam? We survey current and proposed spam filtering techniques with particular emphasis on how well they work. Our primary focus is spam filtering in email; Similarities and differences with spam filtering in other communication and storage media - such as instant messaging and the Web - are addressed peripherally. In doing so we examine the definition of spam, the user's information requirements and the role of the spam filter as one component of a large and complex information universe. Well-known methods are detailed sufficiently to make the exposition self-contained, however, the focus is on considerations unique to spam. Comparisons, wherever possible, use common evaluation measures, and control for differences in experimental setup. Such comparisons are not easy, as benchmarks, measures, and methods for evaluating spam filters are still evolving. We survey these efforts, their results and their limitations. In spite of recent advances in evaluation methodology, many uncertainties (including widely held but unsubstantiated beliefs) remain as to the effectiveness of spam filtering techniques and as to the validity of spam filter evaluation methods. We outline several uncertainties and propose experimental methods to address them.},

Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.},

RQ1: Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM 

RQ2: a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach; Previous findings reported by Malheiros et al. [10] show that the use of VTM reduces the time taken to perform the selection activity and also improves the number of papers correctly included or excluded in SLRs.

RQ3: time taken - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; 
effectiveness - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; Table 1
Our results showed that the time taken by students 1 and 2 to perform the study selection activity on the basis of reading the abstracts was 85 and 54 minutes respectively; and the time taken by students 3 and 4 to perform the same activity using the VTM approach was 30 and 58 minutes respectively. The performance of the students using the VTM appeared to be either equivalent to or better than that of the students using the manual method.

abstract = {This paper compares different approaches for using deep neural networks (DNNs) trained to predict senone posteriors for the task of spoken language recognition (SLR). These approaches have recently been found to outperform various baseline systems on different datasets, but they have not yet been compared to each other or to a common baseline. Two of these approaches use the DNNs to generate feature vectors which are then processed in different ways to predict the score of each language given a test sample. The features are extracted either from a bottleneck layer in the DNN or from the output layer. In the third approach, the standard i-vector extraction procedure is modified to use the senones as classes and the DNN to predict the zeroth order statistics. We compare these three approaches and conclude that the approach based on bottleneck features followed by i-vector modeling outperform the other two approaches. We also show that score-level fusion of some of these approaches leads to gains over using a single approach for short-duration test samples. Finally, we demonstrate that fusing systems that use DNNs trained with several languages leads to improvements in performance over the best single system, and we propose an adaptation procedure for DNNs trained with languages with less available data. Overall, we show improvements between 40{\%} and 70{\%} relative to a state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM) i-vector system on test durations from 3 seconds to 120 seconds on two significantly different tasks: the NIST 2009 language recognition evaluation task and the DARPA RATS language identification task.},

abstract = {Within the framework of the strategic research project Xsense at the Technical University of Denmark, we are developing a colorimetric sensor array which can be useful for detection of explosives like DNT, TNT, HMX, RDX and TATP and identification of volatile organic compounds in the presence of water vapor in air. In order to analyze colorimetric sensors with statistical methods, the sensory output must be put into numerical form suitable for analysis. We present new ways of extracting features from a colorimetric sensor and determine the quality and robustness of these features using machine learning classifiers. Sensors, and in particular explosive sensors, must not only be able to classify explosives, they must also be able to measure the certainty of the classifier regarding the decision it has made. This means there is a need for classifiers that not only give a decision, but also give a posterior probability about the decision. We will compare K-nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks and sparse logistic regression for colorimetric sensor data analysis. Using the sparse solutions we perform feature selection and feature ranking and compare to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.},

This problem finds a communication gap between the people belonging to different community. Communication is always having a great impact in every domain and how it is considered the meaning of the thoughts andexpressions that attract the researchers to bridge this gap for every living being. In this work, we proposed an idea for feasible communication between hearing impaired and normal person with the help of machine learning approach. Instead of preprocessing techniques, like filtering and segmentation of hand patch images, we extract features from our dataset by discrete wavelet transform. The dimension of the feature vector is reduced by linear discriminant analysis. Both linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) are used on the basis of tenfold classification to recognition sign language symbols. This work ensures the 97.3{\%} accuracy on random sign symbolic dataset of gestural communication.},

abstract = {A sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention from researchers working in the fields of natural language processing and text mining. However, there is a lack of annotated data sets that can be used to train a model for all domains, which is hampering the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Many research studies have attempted to tackle this issue and to improve cross-domain sentiment classification. In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive systematic literature review of the methods and techniques employed in a cross-domain sentiment analysis. We focus on studies published during the period of 2010-2016. From our analysis of those works, it is clear that there is no perfect solution. Hence, one of the aims of this review is to create a resource in the form of an overview of the techniques, methods, and approaches that have been used to attempt to solve the problem of cross-domain sentiment analysis in order to assist researchers in developing new and more accurate techniques in the future.},

abstract = {Objective: Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods have been widely applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to decode brain states. Due to the “high features, low samples” in fMRI data, machine learning methods have been widely regularized using various regularizations to avoid overfitting. Both total variation (TV) using the gradients of images and Euler's elastica (EE) using the gradient and the curvature of images are the two popular regulations with spatial structures. In contrast to TV, EE regulation is able to overcome the disadvantage of TV regulation that favored piecewise constant images over piecewise smooth images. In this study, we introduced EE to fMRI-based decoding for the first time and proposed the EE regularized multinomial logistic regression (EELR) algorithm for multi-class classification. Methods: We performed experimental tests on both simulated and real fMRI data to investigate the feasibility and robustness of EELR. The performance of EELR was compared with sparse logistic regression (SLR) and TV regularized LR (TVLR). Results: The results showed that EELR was more robustness to noises and showed significantly higher classification performance than TVLR and SLR. Moreover, the forward models and weights patterns revealed that EELR detected larger brain regions that were discriminative to each task and activated by each task than TVLR. Conclusion: The results suggest that EELR not only performs well in brain decoding but also reveals meaningful discriminative and activation patterns. Significance: This study demonstrated that EELR showed promising potential in brain decoding and discriminative/activation pattern detection.},

abstract = {Sign language recognition(SLR) is a challenging task due to the diversity of the signs. To tackle the problem, this paper utilize both trajectory features and hand shape features. Since the trajectory features and hand shape features are not in the same domain, it is unreasonable to concatenate them naively or model them with a unified model. To deal with the issue, we adopt Support Vector Machine(SVM) and validation Hidden Markov Models(VHMM), respectively. To depict the direction of the trajectory, we first employ histogram of oriented displacement(HOD) with SVM to SLR. We propose the relative distance features(RDF) by using VHMM to consider the relationship between hands and the other body parts. As for hand shape feature, we explore histogram of oriented gradient(HOG) in local hand regions with VHMM, too. To facilitate late fusion, we normalize the probabilities of different features to the same range and fuse them for the final classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct the experiments both in ChaLearn dataset and our self-build Kinect-based Chinese sign language dataset. The results show that our method outperforms the classical methods and some state-of-the-art methods.},

Yet, less attention has been paid to date to steady-state activities following the onset activities. In this study, we used machine learning to investigate whether steady-state activities in the presence of continuous sounds represent the sound frequency. Sparse Logistic Regression (SLR) decoded the sound frequency from band specific power or phase locking value (PLV) of local field potentials (LFP) from the fourth layer of the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats. Consequently, we found that SLR was able to decode the sound frequency from steady-state neural activities as well as onset activities. This result demonstrates that the steady-state activities contain information about the sound such as sound frequency.},

abstract = {Text Mining is a set of techniques that analyzes large masses of data, extract relations that are unknown beforehand, and provide solutions to help decision-making. Text mining had been used extensively to analyze English text. However, text mining has only been used recently in analyzing Arabic text. As a result the objective of this paper is to present the current state of Arabic text mining. A systematic review has been performed to collect the papers published on the analysis of Arabic text mining. More than one hundred papers were used in our review from different reliable sources, and then they were classified according to their specific domain, and classified again according to the specific techniques used. This paper also provides quantitative analysis of publications according to publication type, year, category, and contributors.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become an established methodology in software engineering (SE) research however they can be very time consuming and error prone. Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Ambiguity in natural language requirements has long been recognized as an inevitable challenge in requirements engineering (RE). Various initiatives have been taken by RE researchers to address the challenges of ambiguity. In this paper the results of a mapping study are presented that focus on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for addressing ambiguity in requirements. Systematic review of the literature resulted in 174 studies on the subject published during 1995 to 2015, and out of these only 28 are empirically evaluated studies that were selected. From of the resulting set of papers, 81{\%} have focused on detecting ambiguity; whereas 4{\%} and 5{\%} are focusing on reducing and removing ambiguity respectively. Addressing syntactic, semantic, and lexical ambiguities has attracted more attention than other types. In spite of all the research efforts, there is a lack of empirical evaluation of NLP tools and techniques for addressing ambiguity in requirements. The results have pointed out some gaps in empirical results and have raised questions the designing of an analytical framework for research in this field. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Prediction of change prone classes leads to higher quality, maintainable software with low cost. This study reports a systematic review of change prediction studies published in journals and conference proceedings. This review will help researchers and practitioners to examine the previous studies from different viewpoints: metrics, data analysis techniques, datasets, and experimental results perspectives. Besides this, the research questions formulated in the review allow us to identify gaps in the current technology. The key findings of the review are: (i) less use of method level metrics, machine learning methods and commercial datasets; (ii) inappropriate use of performance measures and statistical tests; (iii) lack of use of feature reduction techniques; (iv) lack of risk indicators used for identifying change prone classes and (v) inappropriate use of validation methods. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent research on Big Data proposed and evaluated a number of advanced techniques to gain meaningful information from the complex and large volume of data available on the World Wide Web. To achieve accurate text analysis, a process is usually initiated with a Text Classification (TC) method. Reviewing the very recent literature in this area shows that most studies are focused on English (and other scripts) while attempts on classifying Arabic texts remain relatively very limited. Hence, we intend to contribute the first Systematic Literature Review (SLR) utilizing a search protocol strictly to summarize key characteristics of the different TC techniques and methods used to classify Arabic text, this work also aims to identify and share a scientific evidence of the gap in current literature to help suggesting areas for further research. Our SLR explicitly investigates empirical evidence as a decision factor to include studies, then conclude which classifier produced more accurate results. Further, our findings identify the lack of standardized corpuses for Arabic text; authors compile their own, and most of the work is focused on Modern Arabic with very little done on Colloquial Arabic despite its wide use in Social Media Networks such as Twitter. In total, 1464 papers were surveyed from which 48 primary studies were included and analyzed.},
