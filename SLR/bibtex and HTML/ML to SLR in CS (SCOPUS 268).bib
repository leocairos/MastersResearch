abstract = {The presentation of results from Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) is generally done using tables. Prior research suggests that results summarized in tables are often difficult for readers to understand. One alternative to improve results' comprehensibility is to use graphical representations. The aim of this work is twofold: first, to investigate whether graph representations result is better comprehensibility than tables when presenting SLR results; second, to investigate whether interpretation using graphs impacts on performance, as measured by the time consumed to analyse and understand the data. We selected an SLR published in the literature and used two different formats to represent its results - tables and graphs, in three different combinations: (i) table format only; (ii) graph format only; and (iii) a mixture of tables and graphs. We conducted an experiment that compared the performance and capability of experts in SLR, as well as doctoral and masters students, in analysing and understanding the results of the SLR, as presented in one of the three different forms. We were interested in examining whether there is difference between the performance of participants using tables and graphs. The graphical representation of SLR data led to a reduction in the time taken for its analysis, without any loss in data comprehensibility. For our sample the analysis of graphical data proved to be faster than the analysis of tabular data. However, we found no evidence of a difference in comprehensibility whether using tables, graphical format or a combination. Overall we argue that graphs are a suitable alternative to tables when it comes to representing the results of an SLR. {\&}copy; 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Medical systematic reviews answer particular questions within a very specific domain of expertise by selecting and analysing the current pertinent literature. As part of this process, the phase of screening articles usually requires a long time and significant effort as it involves a group of domain experts evaluating thousands of articles in order to find the relevant instances. Our goal is to support this process through automatic tools. There is a recent trend of applying text classification methods to semi-automate the screening phase by providing decision support to the group of experts, hence helping reduce the required time and effort. In this work, we contribute to this line of work by performing a comprehensive set of text classification experiments on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review in the area of Internet-Based Randomised Controlled Trials. These experiments involved applying multiple machine learning algorithms combined with several feature selection techniques to different parts of the articles (i.e., titles, abstract, or both). Results are generally positive in terms of overall precision and recall measurements, reaching values of up to 84{\%}. It is also revealing in terms of how using only article titles provides virtually as good results as when adding article abstracts. Based on the positive results, it is clear that text classification can support the screening stage of medical systematic reviews. However, selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms, related methods, and text sections of articles is a neglected but important requirement because of its significant impact to the end results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In order to preserve the value of Systematic Reviews (SRs), they should be frequently updated considering new evidence that has been produced since the completion of the previous version of the reviews. However, the update of an SR is a time consuming, manual task. Thus, many SRs have not been updated as they should be and, therefore, they are currently outdated. Objective: The main contribution of this paper is to support the update of SRs. Method: We propose USR-VTM, an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques, to support selection of new evidence in the form of primary studies. We then present a tool, named Revis, which supports our approach. Finally, we evaluate our approach through a comparison of outcomes achieved using USR-VTM versus the traditional (manual) approach. Results: Our results show that USR-VTM increases the number of studies correctly included compared to the traditional approach. Conclusions: USR-VTM effectively supports the update of SRs.},

abstract = {In systematic reviews, the growing number of published studies imposes a significant screening workload on reviewers. Active learning is a promising approach to reduce the workload by automating some of the screening decisions, but it has been evaluated for a limited number of disciplines. The suitability of applying active learning to complex topics in disciplines such as social science has not been studied, and the selection of useful criteria and enhancements to address the data imbalance problem in systematic reviews remains an open problem. We applied active learning with two criteria (certainty and uncertainty) and several enhancements in both clinical medicine and social science (specifically, public health) areas, and compared the results in both. The results show that the certainty criterion is useful for finding relevant documents, and weighting positive instances is promising to overcome the data imbalance problem in both data sets. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is also shown to be promising when little manually-assigned information is available. Active learning is effective in complex topics, although its efficiency is limited due to the difficulties in text classification. The most promising criterion and weighting method are the same regardless of the review topic, and unsupervised techniques like LDA have a possibility to boost the performance of active learning without manual annotation.},

@article{Frunza201117,
abstract = {Objective: To determine whether the automatic classification of documents can be useful in systematic reviews on medical topics, and specifically if the performance of the automatic classification can be enhanced by using the particular protocol of questions employed by the human reviewers to create multiple classifiers. Methods and materials: The test collection is the data used in large-scale systematic review on the topic of the dissemination strategy of health care services for elderly people. From a group of 47,274 abstracts marked by human reviewers to be included in or excluded from further screening, we randomly selected 20,000 as a training set, with the remaining 27,274 becoming a separate test set. As a machine learning algorithm we used complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes. We tested both a global classification method, where a single classifier is trained on instances of abstracts and their classification (i.e., included or excluded), and a novel per-question classification method that trains multiple classifiers for each abstract, exploiting the specific protocol (questions) of the systematic review. For the per-question method we tested four ways of combining the results of the classifiers trained for the individual questions. As evaluation measures, we calculated precision and recall for several settings of the two methods. It is most important not to exclude any relevant documents (i.e., to attain high recall for the class of interest) but also desirable to exclude most of the non-relevant documents (i.e., to attain high precision on the class of interest) in order to reduce human workload. Results: For the global method, the highest recall was 67.8{\%} and the highest precision was 37.9{\%}. For the per-question method, the highest recall was 99.2{\%}, and the highest precision was 63{\%}. The human-machine workflow proposed in this paper achieved a recall value of 99.6{\%}, and a precision value of 17.8{\%}. Conclusion: The per-question method that combines classifiers following the specific protocol of the review leads to better results than the global method in terms of recall. Because neither method is efficient enough to classify abstracts reliably by itself, the technology should be applied in a semi-automatic way, with a human expert still involved. When the workflow includes one human expert and the trained automatic classifier, recall improves to an acceptable level, showing that automatic classification techniques can reduce the human workload in the process of building a systematic review. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs)are an important component to identify and aggregate research evidence from different empirical studies. One of the activities associated with the SLR process is the selection of primary studies. The process used to select primary studies can be arduous, particularly when the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies. Aim: An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and effectiveness of graduate students in selecting primary studies manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study. Method: The same experimental design and materials of the previous experiment were used in the current experiment. Result: The previous experiment revealed that VTM techniques can speed up the selection of primary studies and increase the number of studies correctly included/excluded (effectiveness). The results of the replication confirmed that studies are more rapidly selected using VTM. We observed that the level of experience in researching has a direct relationship with the effectiveness. Conclusion: VTM techniques have proven valuable in the selection of primary studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews address a specific clinical question by unbiasedly assessing and analyzing the pertinent literature. Citation screening is a time-consuming and critical step in systematic reviews. Typically, reviewers must evaluate thousands of citations to identify articles eligible for a given review. We explore the application of machine learning techniques to semi-automate citation screening, thereby reducing the reviewers' workload. RESULTS: We present a novel online classification strategy for citation screening to automatically discriminate "relevant" from "irrelevant" citations. We use an ensemble of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) built over different feature-spaces (e.g., abstract and title text), and trained interactively by the reviewer(s). Semi-automating the citation screening process is difficult because any such strategy must identify all citations eligible for the systematic review. This requirement is made harder still due to class imbalance; there are far fewer "relevant" than "irrelevant" citations for any given systematic review. To address these challenges we employ a custom active-learning strategy developed specifically for imbalanced datasets. Further, we introduce a novel undersampling technique. We provide experimental results over three real-world systematic review datasets, and demonstrate that our algorithm is able to reduce the number of citations that must be screened manually by nearly half in two of these, and by around 40{\%} in the third, without excluding any of the citations eligible for the systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a semi-automated citation screening algorithm for systematic reviews that has the potential to substantially reduce the number of citations reviewers have to manually screen, without compromising the quality and comprehensiveness of the review.},

The current practice of manually reviewing all papers returned by complex hand-crafted boolean queries is human labour-intensive and difficult to maintain. We demonstrate a two-stage searching system that takes advantage of ranked queries and support-vector machine text classification to assist in the retrieval of relevant articles, and to restrict results to higher-quality documents. Our proposed approach shows significant work saved in the systematic review process over a baseline of a keyword-based retrieval system.},

abstract = {High cost for systematic review of biomedical literature has generated interest in decreasing overall workload. This can be done by applying natural language processing techniques to 'automate' the classification of publications that are potentially relevant for a given question. Existing solutions need training using a specific supervised machine-learning algorithm and feature-extraction system separately for each systematic review. We propose a system that only uses the input and feedback of human reviewers during the course of review. As the reviewers classify articles, the query is modified using a simple relevance feedback algorithm, and the semantically closest document to the query is presented. An evaluation of our approach was performed using a set of 15 published drug systematic reviews. The number of articles that needed to be reviewed was substantially reduced (ranging from 6{\%} to 30{\%} for a 95{\%} recall).},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate whether (1) machine learning classifiers can help identify nonrandomized studies eligible for full-text screening by systematic reviewers; (2) classifier performance varies with optimization; and (3) the number of citations to screen can be reduced. Methods: We used an open-source, data-mining suite to process and classify biomedical citations that point to mostly nonrandomized studies from 2 systematic reviews. We built training and test sets for citation portions and compared classifier performance by considering the value of indexing, various feature sets, and optimization. We conducted our experiments in 2 phases. The design of phase I with no optimization was: 4 classifiers √ó 3 feature sets √ó 3 citation portions. Classifiers included k-nearest neighbor, na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, and evolutionary support vector machine. Feature sets included bag of words, and 2- and 3-term n-grams. Citation portions included titles, titles and abstracts, and full citations with metadata. Phase II with optimization involved a subset of the classifiers, as well as features extracted from full citations, and full citations with overweighted titles. We optimized features and classifier parameters by manually setting information gain thresholds outside of a process for iterative grid optimization with 10-fold cross-validations. We independently tested models on data reserved for that purpose and statistically compared classifier performance on 2 types of feature sets. We estimated the number of citations needed to screen by reviewers during a second pass through a reduced set of citations. Results: In phase I, the evolutionary support vector machine returned the best recall for bag of words extracted from full citations; the best classifier with respect to overall performance was k-nearest neighbor. No classifier attained good enough recall for this task without optimization. In phase II, we boosted performance with optimization for evolutionary support vector machine and complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers. Generalization performance was better for the latter in the independent tests. For evolutionary support vector machine and complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers, the initial retrieval set was reduced by 46{\%} and 35{\%}, respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning classifiers can help identify nonrandomized studies eligible for full-text screening by systematic reviewers. Optimization can markedly improve performance of classifiers. However, generalizability varies with the classifier. The number of citations to screen during a second independent pass through the citations can be substantially reduced. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to improve on the selection of algorithms for classifier committees applied to reducing the workload of human experts in building systematic reviews used in evidence-based medicine. We focus on clustering pre-selected classifiers based on a multi-measure prediction performance evaluation expressed in terms of a projection from a high-dimensional space to a visualizable two-dimensional one. The best classifier was selected from each cluster and included in the committee. We applied the committee of classifiers to rank biomedical abstracts based on the predicted relevance to the topic under review. We identified a subset of abstracts that represents the bottom of the ranked list (predicted as irrelevant). We used False Negatives (relevant articles mistakenly ranked at the bottom) as a final performance measure. Our early experiments demonstrate that the classifier committee built using our new approach outperformed committees of classifiers arbitrary created from the same list of pre-selected classifiers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews, which summarize the entirety of the evidence pertaining to a specific clinical question, have become critical for evidence-based decision making in healthcare. But such reviews have become increasingly onerous to produce due to the exponentially expanding biomedical literature base. This study proposes a step toward mitigating this problem by automating risk of bias assessment in systematic reviews, in which reviewers determine whether study results may be affected by biases (e.g., poor randomization or blinding). Conducting risk of bias assessment is an important but onerous task. We thus describe a machine learning approach to automate this assessment, using the standard Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool which assesses seven common types of bias. Training such a system would typically require a large labeled corpus, which would be prohibitively expensive to collect here. Instead, we use distant supervision, using data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (a large repository of systematic reviews), to pseudoannotate a corpus of 2200 clinical trial reports in PDF format.We then develop a joint model which, using the full text of a clinical trial report as input, predicts the risks of bias while simultaneously extracting the text fragments supporting these assessments. This study represents a step toward automating or semiautomating extraction of data necessary for the synthesis of clinical trials.},

abstract = {Context Use cases have been widely accepted and acknowledged as a specification tool for specifying the functional requirements of a software system. Many variations of use cases exist which tries to address the issues such as their completeness, degree of formalism, automated information extraction, usability, and pertinence. Objective The aim of this systematic review is to examine the existing literature for the evolution of the use cases, their applications, quality assessments, open issues, and the future directions. Method We perform keyword-based extensive search to identify the relevant studies related to use case specifications research reported in journal articles, conference papers, workshop papers, bulletins and book chapters. Results The specified search process resulted 119 papers, which were published between 1992 and February 2014. This included, 54 journal articles, 42 conference papers, 2 ACM/IEEE bulletins, 12 book chapters, 6 workshop papers and 3 white papers. We found that as many as twenty use case templates have been proposed and applied for various software specification problems ranging from informal descriptions with paragraph-style text to more formal keyword-oriented templates. Conclusion Use cases have been evolved from initial plain, semi-formal textual descriptions to a more formal template structure facilitating automated information extraction in various software development life cycle activities such as requirement documentation, requirement analysis, requirement validation, domain modeling, test case generation, planning and estimation, and maintenance. The issues that remain to be sorted out are (1) the right degree of formalism, (2) the efficient change management, (3) the industrial relevance, and (4) assessment of the quality of the specification. Additionally, its synergy with other software models that are used in the development processes is an issue that needs to be addressed.},

abstract = {Heart failure is a serious condition with high prevalence (about 2{\%} in the adult population in developed countries, and more than 8{\%} in patients older than 75 years). About 3‚Äì5{\%} of hospital admissions are linked with heart failure incidents. Heart failure is the first cause of admission by healthcare professionals in their clinical practice. The costs are very high, reaching up to 2{\%} of the total health costs in the developed countries. Building an effective disease management strategy requires analysis of large amount of data, early detection of the disease, assessment of the severity and early prediction of adverse events. This will inhibit the progression of the disease, will improve the quality of life of the patients and will reduce the associated medical costs. Toward this direction machine learning techniques have been employed. The aim of this paper is to present the state-of-the-art of the machine learning methodologies applied for the assessment of heart failure. More specifically, models predicting the presence, estimating the subtype, assessing the severity of heart failure and predicting the presence of adverse events, such as destabilizations, re-hospitalizations, and mortality are presented. According to the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that such a comprehensive review, focusing on all aspects of the management of heart failure, is presented.},

@inproceedings{Scells2017b,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 ACM. This paper introduces a test collection for evaluating the effectiveness of different methods used to retrieve research studies for inclusion in systematic reviews. Systematic reviews appraise and synthesise studies that meet specific inclusion criteria. Systematic reviews intended for a biomedical science audience use boolean queries with many, often complex, search clauses to retrieve studies; these are then manually screened to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. This process is expensive and time consuming. The development of systems that improve retrieval effectiveness will have an immediate impact by reducing the complexity and resources required for this process. Our test collection consists of approximately 26 million research studies extracted from the freely available MEDLINE database, 94 review (query) topics extracted from Cochrane systematic reviews, and corresponding relevance assessments. Tasks for which the collection can be used for information retrieval system evaluation are described and the use of the collection to evaluate common baselines within one such task is demonstrated. The test collection is available at https://github.com/ielab/SIGIR2017-PICO-Collection.},

abstract = {The PECO framework is a knowledge representation for formulating clinical questions. Queries are decomposed into four aspects, which are Patient-Problem (P), Exposure (E), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). However, no test collection is available to evaluate such framework in information retrieval. In this work, we first present the construction of a large test collection extracted from systematic literature reviews. We then describe an analysis of the distribution of PECO elements throughout the relevant documents and propose a language modeling approach that uses these distributions as a weighting strategy. In our experiments carried out on a collection of 1.5 million documents and 423 queries, our method was found to lead to an improvement of 28{\%} in MAP and 50{\%} in P@5, as compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

The review uses 74 software fault prediction papers in 11 journals and several conference proceedings. According to the review results, the usage percentage of public datasets increased significantly and the usage percentage of machine learning algorithms increased slightly since 2005. In addition, method-level metrics are still the most dominant metrics in fault prediction research area and machine learning algorithms are still the most popular methods for fault prediction. Researchers working on software fault prediction area should continue to use public datasets and machine learning algorithms to build better fault predictors. The usage percentage of class-level is beyond acceptable levels and they should be used much more than they are now in order to predict the faults earlier in design phase of software life cycle. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of molecular biology and computing technology. To characterize the field as convergent domain, researchers have used bibliometrics, augmented with text-mining techniques for content analysis. In previous studies, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was the most representative topic modeling technique for identifying topic structure of subject areas. However, as opposed to revealing the topic structure in relation to metadata such as authors, publication date, and journals, LDA only displays the simple topic structure. METHODS In this paper, we adopt the Tang et al.'s Author-Conference-Topic (ACT) model to study the field of bioinformatics from the perspective of keyphrases, authors, and journals. The ACT model is capable of incorporating the paper, author, and conference into the topic distribution simultaneously. To obtain more meaningful results, we use journals and keyphrases instead of conferences and bag-of-words.. For analysis, we use PubMed to collected forty-six bioinformatics journals from the MEDLINE database. We conducted time series topic analysis over four periods from 1996 to 2015 to further examine the interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics. RESULTS We analyze the ACT Model results in each period. Additionally, for further integrated analysis, we conduct a time series analysis among the top-ranked keyphrases, journals, and authors according to their frequency. We also examine the patterns in the top journals by simultaneously identifying the topical probability in each period, as well as the top authors and keyphrases. The results indicate that in recent years diversified topics have become more prevalent and convergent topics have become more clearly represented. CONCLUSION The results of our analysis implies that overtime the field of bioinformatics becomes more interdisciplinary where there is a steady increase in peripheral fields such as conceptual, mathematical, and system biology. These results are confirmed by integrated analysis of topic distribution as well as top ranked keyphrases, authors, and journals.},

abstract = {The recent decades have witnessed an unprecedented expansion in the volume of unstructured data in digital textual formats. Companies are now starting to recognize the potential economic value lying untapped in their text data repositories and sources, including external ones, such as social media platforms, and internal ones, such as safety reports and other company-specific document collections. Information extracted from these textual data sources is valuable for a range of enterprise application and for informed decision making. In this article we provide a systematic review of the current state of the art in the application of text analytics in industry. Our review is structured along three dimensions: the application context, the methods and techniques utilized, and the evaluation procedure. Based on the review, we identify the different challenges and constraints that an real-world, industrial environment imposes on text analytics techniques, as opposed to their deployment in more controlled, research environments. In addition, we formulate a set of desiderata that text analytics techniques should satisfy in order to alleviate these challenges and to ensure their successful deployment in industry. Furthermore, we discuss future trends in text analytics and their potential application in industry.},

abstract = {End-User Training (EUT) is a method used for learning information systems or applications and improving those skills to become more effective. In order for organizations to provide effective EUT programs, several concerns in the design of EUT need to be considered. The objective of this study is to undertake a systematic literature review to determine the effectiveness of End-User Training, factors, and measurement of the effectiveness of EUT. The review analyzes 50 studies identified for primary studies from academic digital libraries published between 2003 and 2013. The results of this study showed that factors influencing EUT can be categorized into seven categories, which are organizational, individual difference, training methods, learning techniques, learning process and interaction, immediate learning outcomes, and long-term learning outcomes. Therefore, the future research should consider these factors that may impact the EUT before designing and developing effective EUT programs. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {One of the activities associated with the systematic literature review (SLR) process is the selection of primary studies. When the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies to be analysed, the process used to select studies can be arduous, specially when the selection review activity is performed and all studies under analysis are read more than once. An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and accuracy of graduate students in conducting the selection review activity manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study that used the same experimental design and materials of the original experiment. The results have confirmed the outcomes of the original experiment, i.e., VTM is promising and can improve the performance of the selection review of primary studies. There is a positive relationship between the use of VTM techniques and the time spent to conduct the selection review activity.

abstract = {Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have been gaining a significant amount of attention from Software Engineering researchers since 2004. SLRs are considered to be a new research methodology in Software Engineering, which allow evidence to be gathered with regard to the usefulness or effectiveness of the technology proposed in Software Engineering for the development and maintenance of software products. This is demonstrated by the growing number of publications related to SLRs that have appeared in recent years. While some tools exist that can support some or all of the activities of the SLR processes defined in (Kitchenham {\&} Charters, 2007), these are not free. The objective of this paper is to present the SLR-Tool, which is a free tool and is available on the following website: http://alarcosj.esi.uclm.es/SLRTool/, to be used by researchers from any discipline, and not only Software Engineering. SLR-Tool not only supports the process of performing SLRs proposed in (Kitchenham {\&} Charters, 2007), but also provides additional functionalities such as: refining searches within the documents by applying text mining techniques; defining a classification schema in order to facilitate data synthesis; exporting the results obtained to the format of tables and charts; and exporting the references from the primary studies to the formats used in bibliographic packages such as EndNote, BibTeX or Ris. This tool has, to date, been used by members of the Alarcos Research Group and PhD students, and their perception of it is that it is both highly necessary and useful. Our purpose now is to circulate the use of SLR-Tool throughout the entire research community in order to obtain feedback from other users.},

abstract = {Performance of any search engine relies heavily on its Web crawler. Web crawlers are the programs that get webpages from the Web by following hyperlinks. These webpages are indexed by a search engine and can be retrieved by a user query. In the area of Web crawling, we still lack an exhaustive study that covers all crawling techniques. This study follows the guidelines of systematic literature review and applies it to the field of Web crawling. We used the standard procedure of carrying out a systematic literature review on 248 studies from a total of 1488 articles published in 12 leading journals and other premier conferences and workshops. Existing literature about the Web crawler is classified into different key subareas. Each subarea is further divided according to the techniques being used. We analyzed the distribution of various articles using multiple criteria and depicted conclusions. Various studies that use open source Web crawlers are also reported. We have highlighted future areas of research. We call for an increased awareness in various fields of the Web crawler and identify how techniques from other domains can be used for crawling the Web. Limitations and recommendations for future are also discussed.For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.},

abstract = {The objective of technology-assisted review (" TAR ") is to find as much relevant information as possible with reason-able effort. Quality is a measure of the extent to which a TAR method achieves this objective, while reliability is a measure of how consistently it achieves an acceptable result. We are concerned with how to define, measure, and achieve high quality and high reliability in TAR. When quality is defined using the traditional goal-post method of specifying a minimum acceptable recall threshold, the quality and reli-ability of a TAR method are both, by definition, equal to the probability of achieving the threshold. Assuming this defini-tion of quality and reliability, we show how to augment any TAR method to achieve guaranteed reliability, for a quan-tifiable level of additional review effort. We demonstrate this result by augmenting the TAR method supplied as the baseline model implementation for the TREC 2015 Total Recall Track, measuring reliability and effort for 555 top-ics from eight test collections. While our empirical results corroborate our claim of guaranteed reliability, we observe that the augmentation strategy may entail disproportionate effort, especially when the number of relevant documents is low. To address this limitation, we propose stopping criteria for the model implementation that may be applied with no additional review effort, while achieving empirical reliability that compares favorably to the provably reliable method. We further argue that optimizing reliability according to the traditional goal-post method is inconsistent with certain subjective aspects of quality, and that optimizing a Taguchi quality loss function may be more apt.},

abstract = {Subjectivity analysis determines existence of subjectivity in text using subjective clues. It is the first task in opinion mining process. The difference between subjectivity analysis and polarity determination is the latter process subjective text to determine the orientation as positive or negative. There were many techniques used to solve the problem of segregating subjective and objective text. This paper used systematic literature review (SLR) to compile the undertaking study in subjective analysis. SLR is a literature review that collects multiple and critically analyse multiple studies to answer the research questions. Eight research questions were drawn for this purpose. Information such as technique, corpus, subjective clues representation and performance were extracted from 97 articles known as primary studies. This information was analysed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the technique, affecting elements to the performance and missing elements from the subjectivity analysis. The SLR has found that majority of the study are using machine learning approach to identify and learn subjective text due to the nature of subjectivity analysis problem that is viewed as classification problem. The performance of this approach outperformed other approaches though currently it is at satisfactory level. Therefore, more studies are needed to improve the performance of subjectivity analysis.},

abstract = {Objective We conducted a literature search to examine the effects and experiences surrounding the transition from paper to electronic checklists in healthcare settings. We explore the types of electronic checklists being used in health care, how and where they were evaluated and seek to identify the successes and failures of using electronic checklists in healthcare, including use of checklists to ensure completeness of documentation in the electronic medical record. Background Formalized checklist use as a memory and decision aid in aviation has resulted in significant increases in safety in that domain. Checklists have also been successfully introduced to reduce errors in some areas of healthcare; however, in some contexts checklists failed to provide some of the expected benefits. Adapting and integrating checklists electronically into the healthcare workflow provides opportunities and challenges that need to be better understood to make checklist adoption a success in health care. Method We conducted a literature search of the English language literature in MEDLINE using PubMed for peer-reviewed literature of implementation and use of electronic or computerized checklists related to clinical or healthcare use. We reviewed the studies and included in this review those papers that discussed in depth the development process and that conducted controlled studies to assess the effectiveness of checklists and the evaluation of their acceptance in the clinical context. Results The literature search using the keywords electronic checklist OR computerized checklist returned a total of 23 peer-reviewed papers. Out of these 15 were included in the review, with 8 excluded because they did not evaluate checklist use for patient care. Application More rigorous application of known principles and methods from Human Computer Interaction research and the behavioral sciences can provide a clearer, more comprehensive understanding of the conditions that affect the development and use of checklists.},

abstract = {A large set of spoken language resources (SLR) for various European languages is being compiled in several SpeechDat projects with the aim to train and test speech recognizers for voice driven services, mainly over telephone lines. This paper is focused on the annotation conventions applied for the Speechdat SLR. These SLR contain typical examples of short monologue speech utterances with simple orthographic transcriptions in a hierarchically simple annotation structure. The annotation conventions and their underlying principles are described and compared to approaches used for related SLR. The synchronization of the orthographic transcriptions with the corresponding speech files is addressed, and the impact of the selected approach for capturing specific phonological and phonetic phenomena is discussed. In the SpeechDat projects a number of tools have been developed to carry out the transcription of the speech. In this paper, a short description of these tools and their properties is provided. For all SpeechDat projects, an internal validity check of the databases and their annotations is carried out. The procedure of this validation campaign, the performed evaluations, and some of the results are presented.},

For example, at a longer time scale, language may adapt to certain social or demographic variables of a linguistic community. At a shorter time scale, patterns of language use may be adjusted by social structures in real-time. Until recently, datasets large enough to test how socio-cultural properties‚Äî spanning vast amounts of time and space‚Äî influence language change have been difficult to obtain. The emergence of digital computing and storage have brought about an unprecedented ability to collect and classify massive amounts of data. By harnessing the power of big data we can explore what socio-cultural properties influence language use. This chapter explores how social-network structures, in general, contribute to differences in language use. We analyzed over one million online business reviews using network analyses and information theory to quantify social connectivity and language use. Results indicate that perhaps a surprising proportion of variance in individual language use can be accounted for by subtle differences in social-network structures, even after fairly aggressive covariates have been added to regression models. The benefits of utilizing big data as a tool for testing classic theories in cognitive science and as a method toward guiding future research are discussed},

abstract = {Searching for relevant documents is a laborious task involved in preparing systematic reviews of biomedical literature. Currently, complex Boolean queries are iteratively developed, and then each document of the final query result is assessed for relevance. However, the result set sizes of these queries are hard to control, and in practice it is difficult to balance the competing desires to keep result sets to a manageable volume, and yet not exclude relevant documents from consideration. Ranking overcomes these problems by allowing the user to choose the number of documents to be inspected. However, previouswork did not show significant improvements over the Boolean approach when ranked keyword queries based on terms in the Boolean queries, review title, research question or inclusion criteria were used. The extended Boolean retrieval model also provides ranked output, but existing complex Boolean queries can be directly used as formal description of the complex information needs occurring in this domain. In this paper we show that extended Boolean retrieval is able to find a larger quantity of relevant documents than previous approaches when comparable (or greater) numbers of documents are inspected for relevance.},

abstract = {Background. Search and selection of primary studies in System-atic Literature Reviews (SLR) is labour intensive, and hard to repli-cate and update. Aims. We explore a machine learning approach to support semi-automated search and selection in SLRs to address these weaknesses. Method. We 1) train a classiier on an initial set of papers, 2) extend this set of papers by automated search and snowballing, 3) have the researcher validate the top paper, selected by the classiier, and 4) update the set of papers and iterate the process until a stopping criterion is met. Results. We demonstrate with a proof-of-concept tool that the proposed automated search and selection approach generates valid search strings and that the performance for subsets of primary studies can reduce the man-ual work by half. Conclusions. approach is promising and the demonstrated advantages include cost savings and replicability. next steps include further tool development and evaluate the approach on a complete SLR.},

@article{Heckman2011363,
abstract = {Context: Automated static analysis (ASA) identifies potential source code anomalies early in the software development lifecycle that could lead to field failures. Excessive alert generation and a large proportion of unimportant or incorrect alerts (unactionable alerts) may cause developers to reject the use of ASA. Techniques that identify anomalies important enough for developers to fix (actionable alerts) may increase the usefulness of ASA in practice. Objective: The goal of this work is to synthesize available research results to inform evidence-based selection of actionable alert identification techniques (AAIT). Method: Relevant studies about AAITs were gathered via a systematic literature review. Results: We selected 21 peer-reviewed studies of AAITs. The techniques use alert type selection; contextual information; data fusion; graph theory; machine learning; mathematical and statistical models; or dynamic detection to classify and prioritize actionable alerts. All of the AAITs are evaluated via an example with a variety of evaluation metrics. Conclusion: The selected studies support (with varying strength), the premise that the effective use of ASA is improved by supplementing ASA with an AAIT. Seven of the 21 selected studies reported the precision of the proposed AAITs. The two studies with the highest precision built models using the subject program's history. Precision measures how well a technique identifies true actionable alerts out of all predicted actionable alerts. Precision does not measure the number of actionable alerts missed by an AAIT or how well an AAIT identifies unactionable alerts. Inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, subject programs, and ASAs in the selected studies preclude meta-analysis and prevent the current results from informing evidence-based selection of an AAIT. We propose building on an actionable alert identification benchmark for comparison and evaluation of AAIT from literature on a standard set of subjects and utilizing a common set of evaluation metrics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Context The International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) maintains a software development repository with over 6000 software projects. This dataset makes it possible to estimate a project's size, effort, duration, and cost. Objective The aim of this study was to determine how and to what extent, ISBSG has been used by researchers from 2000, when the first papers were published, until June of 2012. Method A systematic mapping review was used as the research method, which was applied to over 129 papers obtained after the filtering process. Results The papers were published in 19 journals and 40 conferences. Thirty-five percent of the papers published between years 2000 and 2011 have received at least one citation in journals and only five papers have received six or more citations. Effort variable is the focus of 70.5{\%} of the papers, 22.5{\%} center their research in a variable different from effort and 7{\%} do not consider any target variable. Additionally, in as many as 70.5{\%} of papers, effort estimation is the research topic, followed by dataset properties (36.4{\%}). The more frequent methods are Regression (61.2{\%}), Machine Learning (35.7{\%}), and Estimation by Analogy (22.5{\%}). ISBSG is used as the only support in 55{\%} of the papers while the remaining papers use complementary datasets. The ISBSG release 10 is used most frequently with 32 references. Finally, some benefits and drawbacks of the usage of ISBSG have been highlighted. Conclusion This work presents a snapshot of the existing usage of ISBSG in software development research. ISBSG offers a wealth of information regarding practices from a wide range of organizations, applications, and development types, which constitutes its main potential. However, a data preparation process is required before any analysis. Lastly, the potential of ISBSG to develop new research is also outlined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BN) have been used for decision making in software engineering for many years. In other fields such as bioinformatics, BNs are rigorously evaluated in terms of the techniques that are used to build the network structure and to learn the parameters. We extend our prior mapping study to investigate the extent to which contextual and methodological details regarding BN construction are reported in the studies. We conduct a systematic literature review on the applications of BNs to predict software quality. We focus on more detailed questions regarding (1) dataset characteristics, (2) techniques used for parameter learning, (3) techniques used for structure learning, (4) use of tools, and (5) model validation techniques. Results on ten primary studies show that BNs are mostly built based on expert knowledge, i.e. structure and prior distributions are defined by experts, whereas authors benefit from BN tools and quantitative data to validate their models. In most of the papers, authors do not clearly explain their justification for choosing a specific technique, and they do not compare their proposed BNs with other machine learning approaches. There is also a lack of consensus on the performance measures to validate the proposed BNs. Compared to other domains, the use of BNs is still very limited and current publications do not report enough details to replicate the studies. We propose a framework that provides a set of guidelines for reporting the essential contextual and methodological details of BNs. We believe such a framework would be useful to replicate and extend the work on BNs.},

abstract = {In the auditory cortex, auditory-evoked onset activities have been extensively investigated as a cortical representation of sound information and the emotional information that is associated with sound. However, less attention has been paid to date to steady-state activities following onset activities. In this study, we used machine learning to investigate whether steady-state neural activities in the presence of continuous sound represented the sound frequency and the emotion that was associated with the sound. A microelectrode array with a grid of 96 sites recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the fourth layer of the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats, and sparse logistic regression (SLR) decoded the sound frequency from the steady-state neural activities of the LFPs. The band-specific power at every recording site and the phase locking values between every pair of recording sites served as the input vectors for SLR. In addition, we investigated how these decoding accuracies depended on either aversive or appetitive auditory classical conditioning. We found that the SLR was able to decode the sound frequency from the steady-state neural activities as well as the onset activities and that the decoding accuracy in particular bands either significantly improved or worsened in a conditioning-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that the steady-state neural activities contained rich information about not only test sounds but also the emotions that were associated with the sounds. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {? 2015 ACM.Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question by interpreting the current pertinent literature. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort to the group of experts. Most of proposed works apply supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to infer exclusion and inclusion rules by observing a human screener. Unless, these techniques holds very little promise in study identification phase, because the rate of excluding citations erroneously still unreasonable. In this paper, we contribute to this line of works by proposing an alternative approach, not yet tested in this domain based on semantic rule-based classifiers. This approach involved applying a novel Hybrid Feature Selection Method (HFSM) within a Class Association Rules (CARs) algorithm. Experiments are conducted on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review. The obtained results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature.},

Stemming is extensively used as a pre-processing tool in the field of natural language processing, information retrieval, and language modeling. Though a lot of advancements have been made in the field, yet organized arrangement of the previous work and efforts are lacking in this field. In this paper, we present a review of the text stemming theory, algorithms, and applications. It first describes the existing literature relevant to text stemming by classifying it according to certain key parameters; then it describes the deep analysis of some well-known stemming algorithms on standard data sets. In the end, the current state-of-the-art and certain open issues related to unsupervised stemming are presented. The main aim of this paper is to provide an extensive and useful understanding of the important aspects of text stemming. The open issues and analysis of the current stemming techniques will help the researchers to think of new lines to conduct research in future.},

abstract = {The naming of imaging procedures is currently not standardized across institutions. As a result, it is a challenge to establish national registries, for instance, a national registry of dose to facilitate comparisons among different types of CT procedures. RSNA's RadLex Playbook is an effort towards addressing this gap (by introducing a unique Playbook identifier called an RPID for each procedure), and the current research focuses on semi-automatically mapping institution-specific procedure descriptions to Playbook entries to assist with this standardization effort. We discuss an algorithm we have developed to facilitate the mapping process which first extracts RadLex codes from the procedure description and then uses the definition of an RPID to determine the most suitable RPID(s) for the extracted set of RadLex codes. We also developed a tool that has three modes of operations-a single procedure mapping mode that allows a user to map a single institution-specific procedure description to a Playbook entry, a bulk mode to process large number of descriptions, and an exploratory mode that assists a user to better understand how the selection of values for various Playbook attributes affects the resulting RPID. We validate our algorithms using 166 production CT procedure descriptions and discuss how the tool can be used by administrators to map institution-specific procedure descriptions to RPIDs.},

abstract = {Context: A systematic literature review(SLR) is a methodology used to find and aggregate all relevant studies about a specific research question or topic of interest. Most of the SLR processes are manually conducted. Automating these processes can reduce the workload and time consumed by human. Method: we use SLR as a methodology to survey the literature about the technologies used to automate SLR processes. Result: from the collected data we found many work done to automate the study selection process but there is no evidence about automation of the planning and reporting process. Most of the authors use machine learning classifiers to automate the study selection process. From our survey, there are processes that are similar to the SLR process for which there are automatic techniques to perform them. Conclusion: Because of these results, we concluded that there should be more research done on the planning, reporting, data extraction and synthesizing processes of SLR. {\textcopyright} 2005 - 2014 JATIT {\&} LLS.

abstract = {Background$\backslash$nThe rapid proliferation of biomedical text makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to identify, synthesize, and utilize developed knowledge in their fields of interest. Automated information extraction procedures can assist in the acquisition and management of this knowledge. Previous efforts in biomedical text mining have focused primarily upon named entity recognition of well-defined molecular objects such as genes, but less work has been performed to identify disease-related objects and concepts. Furthermore, promise has been tempered by an inability to efficiently scale approaches in ways that minimize manual efforts and still perform with high accuracy. Here, we have applied a machine-learning approach previously successful for identifying molecular entities to a disease concept to determine if the underlying probabilistic model effectively generalizes to unrelated concepts with minimal manual intervention for model retraining.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults$\backslash$nWe developed a named entity recognizer (MTag), an entity tagger for recognizing clinical descriptions of malignancy presented in text. The application uses the machine-learning technique Conditional Random Fields with additional domain-specific features. MTag was tested with 1,010 training and 432 evaluation documents pertaining to cancer genomics. Overall, our experiments resulted in 0.85 precision, 0.83 recall, and 0.84 F-measure on the evaluation set. Compared with a baseline system using string matching of text with a neoplasm term list, MTag performed with a much higher recall rate (92.1{\%} vs. 42.1{\%} recall) and demonstrated the ability to learn new patterns. Application of MTag to all MEDLINE abstracts yielded the identification of 580,002 unique and 9,153,340 overall mentions of malignancy. Significantly, addition of an extensive lexicon of malignancy mentions as a feature set for extraction had minimal impact in performance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nConclusion$\backslash$nTogether, these results suggest that the identification of disparate biomedical entity classes in free text may be achievable with high accuracy and only moderate additional effort for each new application domain.},

abstract = {Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured/semi-structured machine-readable documents. Among various IE tasks, extracting actionable intelligence from an ever-increasing amount of data depends critically upon cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) - the task of identifying entity mentions across information sources that refer to the same underlying entity. CDCR is the basis of knowledge acquisition and is at the heart of Web search, recommendations, and analytics. Real time processing of CDCR processes is very important and have various applications in discovering must-know information in real-time for clients in finance, public sector, news, and crisis management. Being an emerging area of research and practice, the reported literature on CDCR challenges and solutions is growing fast but is scattered due to the large space, various applications, and large datasets of the order of peta-/tera-bytes. In order to fill this gap, we provide a systematic review of the state of the art of challenges and solutions for a CDCR process. We identify a set of quality attributes, that have been frequently reported in the context of CDCR processes, to be used as a guide to identify important and outstanding issues for further investigations. Finally, we assess existing tools and techniques for CDCR subtasks and provide guidance on selection of tools and algorithms.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews underpin Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) by addressing precise clinical questions via comprehensive synthesis of all relevant published evidence. Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations.},

abstract = {Information technology has dramatically increased online business opportunities; however these opportunities have also created serious risks in relation to information security. Previously, information security issues were studied in a technological context, but growing security needs have extended researchers' attention to explore the management role in information security management. Various studies have explored different management roles and activities, but none has given a comprehensive picture of these roles and activities to manage information security effectively. So it is necessary to accumulate knowledge about various managerial roles and activities from literature to enable managers to adopt these for a more holistic approach to information security management. In this paper, using a systematic literature review approach, we synthesised literature related to management's roles in information security to explore specific managerial activities to enhance information security management. We found that numerous activities of management, particularly development and execution of information security policy, awareness, compliance training, development of effective enterprise information architecture, IT infrastructure management, business and IT alignment and human resources management, had a significant impact on the quality of management of information security. Thus, this research makes a novel contribution by arguing that a more holistic approach to information security is needed and we suggest the ways in which managers can play an effective role in information security. This research also opens up many new avenues for further research in this area.},

abstract = {Sign language recognition, SLR, using spatial positions and arrangements of the hands over time is a challenging multi-variable time series recognition problem with several potential applications. Here we explore, for SLR purposes, a hierarchically connected network of nodes based on a Bayesian-like paradigm known as hierarchical temporal memory, HTM, that models neocortical principles of organization and information coding. HTM is a broad paradigm for pattern recognition, control, attention and forward prediction that exploits the hierarchy in time and space existing in the physical world during both learning and inference. In this work we focus on HTM capabilities for pattern recognition. We extend the traditional HTM paradigm with an original top node in order to improve HTMs performance in problems where instances unfold over time. The extended top node stores and compares sequences of spatio-temporally codified inputs to handle the temporal evolution of instances in sign language. Sequence comparison is carried out using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment that employs dynamic programming. We compare the performance of the extended HTM with traditional HTMs and machine learning algorithms routinely used in the literature for SLR. The extended HTM improves performance of traditional HTM for SLR, reaching 91{\%} recognition accuracy for a data set of 95 categories of Australian sign language. When sufficient training instances are available, the extended HTM matches or outperforms state of the art methods for SLR such as Hidden Markov Models or Metafeatures T-Classes without the usage of a language model, nor pre-processing of sensor data. The extended HTM employs relatively small feature vectors in comparison to methods in the literature. Our method learns the spatio-temporal data structures and transitions that occur in the data without depending on manually predefined features to be searched for and works well in real time. These results suggest that the extended HTM approach is a valid bioinspired alternative to existing SLR engines and that it can be successfully applied to other machine learning tasks whose input instances also unfold over time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to reduce the assignment time and to increase success of right decision making automated bug assignment approaches presented. To support automated decision making on bug assignment, researchers and practitioners propound various methods, tools and processes. Number of academic and technical sources have increased and this has brought the need to systematically categorize the current studies and practices and to provide an overview. In order to give an overview of current studies, we performed a systematic mapping study in the area of bug assignment. We searched the academic literature using several search engines (e.g., Scopus, and Google Scholar). The SM and its results are based on 93 primary studies, which were published sources like conferences (45), journals (24), symposiums (12), workshops (4) and theses (3) and others (5). As a result, approximately 46{\%} of the primary syudies are emprical studies, and 40{\%} used Bayesian statistics as machine learning method.},

abstract = {Multi-label learning handles datasets where each instance is associated with multiple labels, which are often correlated. As other machine learning tasks, multi-label learning also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which can be mitigated by dimensionality reduction tasks, such as feature selection. The standard approach for multi-label feature selection transforms the multi-label dataset into single-label datasets before using traditional feature selection algorithms. However, this approach often ignores label dependence. This work proposes an alternative method, LCFS, which constructs new labels based on relations between the original labels to augment the label set of the original dataset. Afterwards, the augmented dataset is submitted to the standard multi-label feature selection approach. Experiments using Information Gain as a measure to evaluate features were carried out in 10 multi-label benchmark datasets. For each dataset, the quality of the features selected was assessed by the quality of the classifiers built using the features selected by the standard approach in the original dataset, as well as in the dataset constructed by four LCFS settings. The results show that setting LCFS with simple strategies using pairs of labels gives rise to better classifiers than the ones built using the standard approach in the original dataset. Moreover, these good results are accomplished when a small number of features are selected. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The need to overcome the weaknesses of single estimation techniques for prediction tasks has given rise to ensemble methods in software development effort estimation (SDEE). An ensemble effort estimation (EEE) technique combines several of the single/classical models found in the SDEE literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has yet been performed with a focus on the use of EEE techniques in SDEE. The purpose of this review is to analyze EEE techniques from six viewpoints: single models used to construct ensembles, ensemble estimation accuracy, rules used to combine single estimates, accuracy comparison of EEE techniques with single models, accuracy comparison between EEE techniques and methodologies used to construct ensemble methods. We performed a systematic review of EEE studies published between 2000 and 2016, and we selected 24 of them to address the questions raised in this review. We found that EEE techniques may be separated into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous, and that the machine learning single models are the most frequently employed in constructing EEE techniques. We also found that EEE techniques usually yield acceptable estimation accuracy, and in fact are more accurate than single models.},

abstract = {The quality of the interpretation of the sentiment in the online buzz in the social media and the online news can determine the predictability of financial markets and cause huge gains or losses. That is why a number of researchers have turned their full attention to the different aspects of this problem lately. However, there is no well-rounded theoretical and technical framework for approaching the problem to the best of our knowledge. We believe the existing lack of such clarity on the topic is due to its interdisciplinary nature that involves at its core both behavioral-economic topics as well as artificial intelligence. We dive deeper into the interdisciplinary nature and contribute to the formation of a clear frame of discussion. We review the related works that are about market prediction based on online-text-mining and produce a picture of the generic components that they all have. We, furthermore, compare each system with the rest and identify their main differentiating factors. Our comparative analysis of the systems expands onto the theoretical and technical foundations behind each. This work should help the research community to structure this emerging field and identify the exact aspects which require further research and are of special significance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Introduction Most data extraction efforts in epidemiology are focused on obtaining targeted information from clinical trials. In contrast, limited research has been conducted on the identification of information from observational studies, a major source for human evidence in many fields, including environmental health. The recognition of key epidemiological information (e.g., exposures) through text mining techniques can assist in the automation of systematic reviews and other evidence summaries. Method We designed and applied a knowledge-driven, rule-based approach to identify targeted information (study design, participant population, exposure, outcome, confounding factors, and the country where the study was conducted) from abstracts of epidemiological studies included in several systematic reviews of environmental health exposures. The rules were based on common syntactical patterns observed in text and are thus not specific to any systematic review. To validate the general applicability of our approach, we compared the data extracted using our approach versus hand curation for 35 epidemiological study abstracts manually selected for inclusion in two systematic reviews. Results The returned F-score, precision, and recall ranged from 70{\%} to 98{\%}, 81{\%} to 100{\%}, and 54{\%} to 97{\%}, respectively. The highest precision was observed for exposure, outcome and population (100{\%}) while recall was best for exposure and study design with 97{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively. The lowest recall was observed for the population (54{\%}), which also had the lowest F-score (70{\%}). Conclusion The generated performance of our text-mining approach demonstrated encouraging results for the identification of targeted information from observational epidemiological study abstracts related to environmental exposures. We have demonstrated that rules based on generic syntactic patterns in one corpus can be applied to other observational study design by simple interchanging the dictionaries aiming to identify certain characteristics (i.e., outcomes, exposures). At the document level, the recognised information can assist in the selection and categorization of studies included in a systematic review.},

abstract = {With the expansion and acceptance of Word Wide Web, sentiment analysis has become progressively popular research area in information retrieval and web data analysis. Due to the huge amount of user-generated contents over blogs, forums, social media, etc., sentiment analysis has attracted researchers both in academia and industry, since it deals with the extraction of opinions and sentiments. In this paper, we have presented a review of topic modeling, especially LDA-based techniques, in sentiment analysis. We have presented a detailed analysis of diverse approaches and techniques, and compared the accuracy of different systems among them. The results of different approaches have been summarized, analyzed and presented in a sophisticated fashion. This is the really effort to explore different topic modeling techniques in the capacity of sentiment analysis and imparting a comprehensive comparison among them.},

abstract = {Software maintenance starts as early as the first artifacts are delivered. Despite keeping maintenance activities on track is a high cost activity, it is mandatory for the software project success. In this effect, Change Request (CR) repositories are fundamental in softwaremaintenance. They facilitate the management of CRs, as well as they are the central point where stakeholders coordinate activities and communicate. However, the benefits of CR repositories do not come without burdens, and commonly occurring issues should be handled, such as: duplicate CRs; large amounts of CRs that must be assigned; or poorly described CRs. These characteristics led to an increasing interest in the investigation of CR repositories considering different aspects of software development and CR management. Thus, we performed a systematic mapping study to characterize this investigation.We considered 142 studies, which we classified in two ways. First, we classified the studies in different topics, which in turn were grouped into two categories: challenges and opportunities. Second, we provided a classification for the challenge topics built upon an existing taxonomy for Information Retrieval models. In addition, we investigated tools and services for CRs management, to understand if they addressed the identified topics, and how they do it.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews are considered fundamental tools for Evidence-Based Medicine. Such reviews require frequent and time- consuming updating. This study aims to compare the performance of combining relatively simple Bayesian classifiers using a fixed rule, to the relatively complex linear Support Vector Machine for medical systematic reviews. A collection of four systematic drug reviews is used to compare the performance of the classifiers in this study. Cross-validation experiments were performed to evaluate performance. We found that combining Discriminative Multinomial Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and Complement Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes performs equally well or better than SVM while being about 25{\%} faster than SVM in training time. The results support the usefulness of using an ensemble of Bayesian classifiers for machine learning-based automation of systematic reviews of medical topics, especially when datasets have a large number of abstracts. Further work is needed to integrate the powerful features of such Bayesian classifiers together. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a means to synthesize relevant and high quality studies related to a specific topic or research questions. In general, a SLR has three phases, and the first one is the Primary Selection in which the selection of studies is usually performed manually reading title, abstract and keywords of each study. The number of published scientific studies has grown, increasing effort in carrying out this review. In this paper, we proposed two strategies to rank studies in decreasing order of importance, for a SLR, regarding the terms in the search string. These strategies are based on the Information Retrieval technique Vector Model. We implemented those strategies and conducted a case study to evaluate their applicability. As results, the second strategy presents 50{\%} of precision on a recall of 80{\%}. Among the contributions of this study, two strategies to rank relevant documents in a SLR, regarding the search string, were proposed and analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Most existing systems that identify protein-protein interaction (PPI) in literature make decisions solely on evidence within a single sentence and ignore the rich context of PPI descriptions in large corpora. Moreover, they often suffer from the heavy burden of manual annotation. Methods: To address these problems, a new relational-similarity (RS)-based approach exploiting context in large-scale text is proposed. A basic RS model is first established to make initial predictions. Then word similarity matrices that are sensitive to the PPI identification task are constructed using a corpus-based approach. Finally, a hybrid model is developed to integrate the word similarity model with the basic RS model. Results: The experimental results show that the basic RS model achieves F-scores much higher than a baseline of random guessing on interactions (from 50.6{\%} to 75.0{\%}) and non-interactions (from 49.4{\%} to 74.2{\%}). The hybrid model further improves F-score by about 2{\%} on interactions and 3{\%} on non-interactions. Conclusion: The experimental evaluations conducted with PPIs in well-known databases showed the effectiveness of our approach that explores context information in PPI identification. This investigation confirmed that within the framework of relational similarity, the word similarity model relieves the data sparseness problem in similarity calculation.},

Usually such approaches a) omit variability information and b) rely on artifacts that reside in advanced phases of the development process, thus, being only of limited usefulness in the context of SPLs. In contrast, feature and variability extraction from natural language (NL) documents is more favorable, because a mapping to several other artifacts is usually established from the very beginning. In this paper, we provide a multi-dimensional overview of approaches for feature and variability extraction from NL documents by means of a systematic literature review (SLR). We selected 25 primary studies and carefully evaluated them regarding different aspects such as techniques used, tool support, or accuracy of the results. In a nutshell, our key insights are that i) standard NLP techniques are commonly used, ii) post-processing often includes clustering {\&} machine learning algorithms, iii) only in rare cases, the approaches support variability extraction, iv) tool support, apart from text pre-processing is often not available, and v) many approaches lack a comprehensive evaluation. Based on these observations, we derive future challenges, arguing that more effort need to be invested for making such approaches applicable in practice.},

abstract = {Background: Since the introduction of the systematic review process to Software Engineering in 2004, researchers have investigated a number of ways to mitigate the amount of effort and time taken to filter through large volumes of literature. Aim: This study aims to provide a critical analysis of text mining techniques used to support the citation screening stage of the systematic review process. Method: We critically re-reviewed papers included in a previous systematic review which addressed the use of text mining methods to support the screening of papers for inclusion in a review. The previous review did not provide a detailed analysis of the text mining methods used. We focus on the availability in the papers of information about the text mining methods employed, including the description and explanation of the methods, parameter settings, assessment of the appropriateness of their application given the size and dimensionality of the data used, performance on training, testing and validation data sets, and further information that may support the reproducibility of the included studies. Results: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB) and Committee of classifiers (Ensemble) are the most used classification algorithms. In all of the studies, features were represented with Bag-of-Words (BOW) using both binary features (28{\%}) and term frequency (66{\%}). Five studies experimented with n-grams with n between 2 and 4, but mostly the unigram was used. $\chi$2, information gain and tf-idf were the most commonly used feature selection techniques. Feature extraction was rarely used although LDA and topic modelling were used. Recall, precision, F and AUC were the most used metrics and cross validation was also well used. More than half of the studies used a corpus size of below 1,000 documents for their experiments while corpus size for around 80{\%} of the studies was 3,000 or fewer documents. The major common ground we found for comparing performance assessment based on independent replication of studies was the use of the same dataset but a sound performance comparison could not be established because the studies had little else in common. In most of the studies, insufficient information was reported to enable independent replication. The studies analysed generally did not include any discussion of the statistical appropriateness of the text mining method that they applied. In the case of applications of SVM, none of the studies report the number of support vectors that they found to indicate the complexity of the prediction engine that they use, making it impossible to judge the extent to which over-fitting might account for the good performance results. Conclusions: There is yet to be concrete evidence about the effectiveness of text mining algorithms regarding their use in the automation of citation screening in systematic reviews. The studies indicate that options are still being explored, but there is a need for better reporting as well as more explicit process details and access to datasets to facilitate study replication for evidence strengthening. In general, the reader often gets the impression that text mining algorithms were applied as magic tools in the reviewed papers, relying on default settings or default optimization of available machine learning toolboxes without an in-depth understanding of the statistical validity and appropriateness of such tools for text mining purposes.},

abstract = {Sentiment prediction emerged as an important machine learning topic to gain insights from unstructured texts, recently gained popularity in health-care industries. Text mining has long been a fundamental data analytic for sentiment prediction. A popular pre-processing step in text mining is transforming text strings to word vectors which form a high-dimensional sparse matrix. This sparse matrix poses computational challenges to induction of accurate sentiment prediction model. Feature selection has been a popular dimensionality reduction technique that finds a subset of features from all the original features from the sparse matrix, in order to enhance the accuracy of the prediction model. In this paper, a new feature selection method called Optimized Swarm Search-based Feature Selection (OSS-FS) is applied. OSS-FS is a swarm-type of searching function that selects an ideal subset of features for enhanced classification accuracy. The swarm search in OSS-FS is optimized by a simple feature evaluation technique called Clustering-by-Coefficient-of-Variation (CCV). The proposed scheme is applied and verified via a case scenario where 279 medical articles related to 'meaningful use functionalities on health care quality, safety, and efficiency' from a systematic review of the health IT literature from January 2010 to August 2013. A multi-class of sentiments, positive, mixed-positive, neutral and negative would have to be recognized from the document contents, by computer using text mining. The results show superiority of OSS-FS over the traditional feature selection methods. The proposed sentiment prediction model will be useful for estimating the sentiments of the readers from some medical literatures. Authors may gauge the potential sentiments of their articles before they get published out.},

abstract = {Context: In order to preserve the value of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs), they should be frequently updated including new studies produced after the conduction of the reviews. However, most of SLRs are outdated and there is a lack of works that support the conduction of SLRs updates. Objective: The main goal of this paper is to report our experience in updating two of our SLRs. Method: To update these two SLRs, we used automated techniques based on VTM (Visual Text Mining) to guarantee the presence of relevant studies. Results: From our experience, some factors to satisfactorily update SLRs were identified: (i) to adopt software tools to support the updating process; (ii) to provide as much as possible information of previous SLR; (iii) to involve researchers from previous SLR; and (iv) to reuse protocol from preliminar SLR. Conclusions: Reported lessons learned can be used as a basis of knowledge to guide researchers when updating their SLRs.},

RQ1: based on VTM (Visual Text Mining); Moreover, VTM has also been beneficial to update SLRs [4] and an approach, called USR‚ÄìVTM, was proposed and will be also explored in the context of this paper. Because of this, a summary of this approach is presented in next section.

RQ2:an experiment to compare the outcomes achieved using this approach to the ones using traditional (manual) approach; updating two
SLRs;

RQ3: Aiming to select the primary studies to be in fact included
in SLR1', two researchers performed independently ... A total of 23 studies (27.4{\%} of 84 studies) were considered to be further analyzed. After that, we used the techniques based on VTM... As mentioned previously, the 14 studies included in SLR1 are coloured in green, the 50 studies excluded in SLR1 are coloured in red, and the 23 studies to be analyzed are coloured in grey...

RQ4: to support the update of SLRs; The main advantage of USR‚ÄìVTM is that the selection activity (classification of studies as included or excluded) is based on previous knowledge.

CQ1: an experience report on the use of our approach to update SLRs executed by SE researchers; Considering our experience with regard to both updates and other SLRs that we have updated in the last years, following, we discuss four main lessons learned
CQ2: Sim, no capitulo III
CQ3: Compara{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com 2 SLRs (do mesmo autor)
CQ4: Sim, resultado compativo (manual vs tecnica)
CQ5: Sim, "showed that the use of USR-VTM approach

abstract = {Abstract Requirements for implemented system can be extracted and reused for a production of a new similar system. Extraction of common and variable features from requirements leverages the benefits of the software product lines engineering (SPLE). Although various approaches have been proposed in feature extractions from natural language (NL) requirements, no related literature review has been published to date for this topic. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of the state-of-the-art approaches in feature extractions from NL requirements for reuse in SPLE. We have included 13 studies in our synthesis of evidence and the results showed that hybrid natural language processing approaches were found to be in common for overall feature extraction process. A mixture of automated and semi-automated feature clustering approaches from data mining and information retrieval were also used to group common features, with only some approaches coming with support tools. However, most of the support tools proposed in the selected studies were not made available publicly and thus making it hard for practitioners' adoption. As for the evaluation, this SLR reveals that not all studies employed software metrics as ways to validate experiments and case studies. Finally, the quality assessment conducted confirms that practitioners' guidelines were absent in the selected studies.},

abstract = {‚ÄîDemand-side management technology is a key ele-ment of the proposed smart grid, which will help utilities make more efficient use of their generation assets by reducing con-sumers' energy demand during peak load periods. However, although some modern appliances can respond to price signals from the utility companies, there is a vast stock of older appli-ances that cannot. For such appliances, utilities must infer what appliances are operating in a home, given only the power signals on the main feeder to the home (i.e., the home's power con-sumption must be disaggregated into individual appliances). We report on an in-depth investigation of multi-label classification algorithms for disaggregating appliances in a power signal. A sys-tematic review of this research topic shows that this class of algo-rithms has received little attention in the literature, even though it is arguably a more natural fit to the disaggregation problem than the traditional single-label classifiers used to date. We exam-ine a multi-label meta-classification framework (RAkEL), and a bespoke multi-label classification algorithm (MLkNN), employ-ing both time-domain and wavelet-domain feature sets. We test these classifiers on two real houses from the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset. We found that the multilabel algorithms are effective and competitive with published results on the datasets.},

It is a well observed phenomenon that due to concentration of educational, career, and business opportunities along with easy access to services, population is increasing in urban centers. Increasing population in urban centers is posing many challenges to urban managers and engineers. Ensuring smooth vehicular traffic flow is very important among them. It includes maintenance of current traffic infrastructure, optimal deployment of traffic regulators and cost effective extension of existing infrastructure which requires experimentation of different what-if scenarios. Urban traffic is among those systems which cannot be interrupted in order to experiment hence simulation is most suitable option for policy makers to perform different what-if scenarios. Choice of vehicular traffic flow simulator play a vital role in experimenting these what-if scenarios. This paper presents a systematic review of existing vehicular traffic flow simulators presented and used in research literature.

abstract = {Background: Software fault prediction is the process of developing models that can be used by the software practitioners in the early phases of software development life cycle for detecting faulty constructs such as modules or classes. There are various machine learning techniques used in the past for predicting faults. Method: In this study we perform a systematic review of studies from January 1991 to October 2013 in the literature that use the machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. We assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. We also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. Further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. Results: In this paper we have identified 64 primary studies and seven categories of the machine learning techniques. The results prove the prediction capability of the machine learning techniques for classifying module/class as fault prone or not fault prone. The models using the machine learning techniques for estimating software fault proneness outperform the traditional statistical models. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability for predicting software fault proneness and can be used by software practitioners and researchers. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in software fault prediction is still limited and more number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work.},

abstract = {This review concentrates on the issue of acquisition of abstract words in a cognitive robot with the grounding principle, from relevant theories to practical models of agents and robots. Most cognitive robotics models developed for grounding of language take inspiration from the findings of neuroscience and psychology to get the theoretical skeleton of these models. To better understand these modelling approaches, it is indispensable to work from the base (theoretical accounts) to the top (computational models). Therefore in this paper, succinct definition of abstract words is presented first, and then the symbol grounding issue and accounts of grounded cognition for abstract words are given. The next section discusses the computational modelling approaches for abstract words grounding phenomenon. Finally, important cognitive robotics models are reviewed. This paper also points out the strengths and weaknesses of relevant hypotheses and models for the representation of abstract words in the grounded cognition framework and helps the understanding of issues such as where and why modelling efforts stand to address this problem in comparison with theoretical findings.},

abstract = {‚ÄîTo uncover interesting and actionable information from natural language documents authored by software develop-ers, many researchers rely on " out-of-the-box " NLP libraries. However, software artifacts written in natural language are different from other textual documents due to the technical language used. In this paper, we first analyze the state of the art through a systematic literature review in which we find that only a s‚Ä∫mall minority of papers justify their choice of an NLP library. We then report on a series of experiments in which we applied four state-of-the-art NLP libraries to publicly available software artifacts from three different sources. Our results show low agreement between different libraries (only between 60{\%} and 71{\%} of tokens were assigned the same part-of-speech tag by all four libraries) as well as differences in accuracy depending on source: For example, spaCy achieved the best accuracy on Stack Overflow data with nearly 90{\%} of tokens tagged correctly, while it was clearly outperformed by Google's SyntaxNet when parsing GitHub ReadMe files. Our work implies that researchers should make an informed decision about the particular NLP library they choose and that customizations to libraries might be necessary to achieve good results when analyzing software artifacts written in natural language.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews are essential for evaluating biomedical treatment options, but the growing size and complexity of the available biomedical literature combined with the rigor of the systematic review method mean that systematic reviews are extremely difficult and laborintensive to perform. In this article, I propose a method of searching the literature by systematically mining the various types of citation relationships between articles. I then test the method by comparing its precision and recall to that of 14 published systematic reviews. The method successfully retrieved 74{\%} of the studies included in these reviews and 90{\%} of the studies it could reasonably be expected to retrieve. The method also retrieved fewer than half of the total number of publications retrieved by these reviews and can be performed in substantially less time. This suggests that the proposed method offers a promising complement to traditional text-based methods of literature identification and retrieval for systematic reviews.},

abstract = {With the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, an increasing number of decision-making tasks are delegated to software systems. A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today's increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated.},

The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying all relevant studies in an unbiased way both complex and time consuming to the extent that jeopardizes the validity of their findings and the ability to inform policy and practice in a timely manner. The CLEF 2017 e-Health Lab Task 2 focuses on the efficient and effective ranking of studies during the abstract and title screening phase of conducting Diagnostic Test Accuracy systematic reviews. We constructed a benchmark collection of fifty such reviews and the corresponding relevant and irrelevant articles found by the original Boolean query. Fourteen teams participated in the task, submitting 68 automatic and semi-automatic runs, using information retrieval and machine learning algorithms over a variety of text representations, in a batch and iterative manner. This paper reports both the methodology used to construct the benchmark collection, and the results of the evaluation.},

abstract = {Software engineering predictive modeling involves construction of models, with the help of software metrics, for estimating quality attributes. Recently, the use of search-based techniques have gained importance as they help the developers and project-managers in the identification of optimal solutions for developing effective prediction models. In this paper, we perform a systematic review of 78 primary studies from January 1992 to December 2015 which analyze the predictive capability of search-based techniques for ascertaining four predominant software quality attributes, i.e., effort, defect proneness, maintainability and change proneness. The review analyses the effective use and application of search-based techniques by evaluating appropriate specifications of fitness functions, parameter settings, validation methods, accounting for their stochastic natures and the evaluation of developmental models with the use of well-known statistical tests. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of different models, developed using the various search-based techniques amongst themselves, and also with the prevalent machine learning techniques used in literature. Although there are very few studies which use search-based techniques for predicting maintainability and change proneness, we found that the results of the application of search-based techniques for effort estimation and defect prediction are encouraging. Hence, this comprehensive study and the associated results will provide guidelines to practitioners and researchers and will enable them to make proper choices for applying the search-based techniques to their specific situations.},

abstract = {One of the activities associated with the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process is the selection review of primary studies. When the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies to be analyzed, the process used to select studies can be arduous. In a previous experiment, we conducted a pilot test to compare the performance and accuracy of PhD students in conducting the selection review activity manually and using Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques. The goal of this paper is to describe a replication study involving PhD and Master students. The replication study uses the same experimental design and materials of the original experiment. This study also aims to investigate whether the researcher's level of experience with conducting SLRs and research in general impacts the outcome of the primary study selection step of the SLR process. The replication results have confirmed the outcomes of the original experiment, i.e., VTM is promising and can improve the performance of the selection review of primary studies. We also observed that both accuracy and performance increase in function of the researcher's experience level in conducting SLRs. The use of VTM can indeed be beneficial during the selection review activity. {\textcopyright} 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Automatic sign language recognition (SLR) is an important topic within the areas of human-computer interaction and machine learning. On the one hand, it poses a complex challenge that requires the intervention of various knowledge areas, such as video processing, image processing, intelligent systems and linguistics. On the other hand, robust recognition of sign language could assist in the translation process and the integration of hearing-impaired people, as well as the teaching of sign language for the hearing population. SLR systems usually employ Hidden Markov Models, Dynamic Time Warping or similar models to recognize signs. Such techniques exploit the sequential ordering of frames to reduce the number of hypothesis. This paper presents a general probabilistic model for sign classification that combines sub-classifiers based on different types of features such as position, movement and handshape. The model employs a bag-of-words approach in all classification steps, to explore the hypothesis that ordering is not essential for recognition. The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97{\%} on an Argentinian Sign Language dataset containing 64 classes of signs and 3200 samples, providing some evidence that indeed recognition without ordering is possible. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract = {‚Äî The growing number of scientific publications and the availability of information in online repositories enable researchers to discover, analyze and maintain an updated state of the art bibliography. Indeed, few works explore this scenario in order to support researchers on the literature review step. Literature reviewing comprises a fundamental part of the scientific writing, in which publications are evaluated and selected by relevance. Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research. Experiments showed good results on learning performance when using a hybrid approach, increasing testing performance in 12{\%}, achieving 89.05{\%} in accuracy when classifying a paper as relevant.},

World Wide Web is a fastest medium for opinion collection from users. Human perception and user opinion has greater potential for knowledge discovery and decision support. In this paper we have presented a survey which covers techniques and methods that promise to enable us to get opinion oriented information from text. This research effort deals with techniques and challenges related to sentiment analysis and opinion mining. We have followed systematic literature review process to conduct this survey. Our focus was mainly on machine learning techniques on the basis of their usage and importance for opinion mining.

This paper presents a fault sampling method where a summary of a few, easily available metrics is used together with the results of a few sampled classes to generalize the fault content to an entire system. The method is tested on a large software system written in Java, that currently consists of around 2000 classes and 300,000 lines of code. The evaluation shows that the fault generalization method is good at predicting fault-prone clusters and that it is possible to generalize the values of a few representative classes.},

As a result, much medical and healthcare research is based off of systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published results. However, when research involves the use of aggregated data from multiple studies, traditional machine learning-based means of analysis cannot be used. This paper describes diversity of data and results available in published man-uscripts, and relates them to a rule learning method that can be applied to build classification and predictive models from such input. The method can be used to support meta-analysis and systematic reviews. Two ap-plication areas are used to illustrate the discussed issues: diagnosis of liver diseases in patients with metabolic syndrome, and detection of polycystic ovary syndrome.},

abstract = {While systematic reviews (SRs) are positioned as an essential element of modern evidence-based medical practice, the creation of these reviews is resource intensive. To mitigate this problem there has been some attempts to leverage supervised machine learning to automate the article triage procedure. This approach has been proved to be helpful for updating existing SRs. However, this technique holds very little promise for creating new SRs because training data is rarely available when it comes to SR creation. In this research we propose an active machine learning approach to overcome this labeling bottleneck and develop a classifier for supporting the creation of systematic reviews. The results indicate that active learning based sample selection could significantly reduce the human effort and is viable technique for automating medical systematic review creation with very few training dataset.},

abstract = {Researchers are finding it more and more difficult to follow the changing status of disease candidate genes due to the exponential increase in gene mapping studies. The Text-mined Hypertension, Obesity and Diabetes candidate gene database (T-HOD) is developed to help trace existing research on three kinds of cardiovascular diseases: hypertension, obesity and diabetes, with the last disease categorized into Type 1 and Type 2, by regularly and semiautomatically extracting HOD-related genes from newly published literature. Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for hypertension, obesity and diabetes, respectively. T-HOD employed the state-of-art text-mining technologies, including a gene/disease identification system and a disease-gene relation extraction system, which can be used to affirm the association of genes with three diseases and provide more evidence for further studies. The primary inputs of T-HOD are the three kinds of diseases, and the output is a list of disease-related genes that can be ranked based on their number of appearance, protein-protein interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Unlike manually constructed disease gene databases, the content of T-HOD is regularly updated by our text-mining system and verified by domain experts. The interface of T-HOD facilitates easy browsing for users and allows T-HOD curators to verify data efficiently. We believe that T-HOD can help life scientists in search for more disease candidate genes in a less time- and effort-consuming manner. Database URL: http://bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw/THOD.},

abstract = {The difficulties of basing healthcare on literary warrant have been explained in different ways: busy practitioners have no time to read extensively, physical access is difficult, and adequate surrogates for texts like indexes, abstracts, systematic reviews are partial in their coverage. The author suggests that a deeper problem of domain conflict must be addressed. This paper reviews problems identified in previous research on evidence-based nursing practice, which indicates that there are conflicts between medical and nursing domains. EBM (evidence-based medicine, or 'text') poses challenges for nurses (proponents of 'caritas'). An additional surrogate for the medical corpus, the clinical guideline, is discussed. When based on inclusive consultation, this may prove to be a hospitable epistemological bridge for groups whose domains are in conflict. Drawing on 'social studies of science' literature, the author explores the provenance and status of the clinical guideline as a 'translation artefact' or bridging mechanism, and presents a 'snapshot' case study of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network in 1998. She suggests that the clinical guideline is a powerful documentary genre, which links several strands of information science: information retrieval, literary warrant and the politics of classification.},

abstract = {Objectives: In this paper, an alignment-free method for DNA barcode classification that is based on both a spectral representation and a neural gas network for unsupervised clustering is proposed. Methods: In the proposed methodology, distinctive words are identified from a spectral representation of DNA sequences. A taxonomic classification of the DNA sequence is then performed using the sequence signature, i.e., the smallest set of k-mers that can assign a DNA sequence to its proper taxonomic category. Experiments were then performed to compare our method with other supervised machine learning classification algorithms, such as support vector machine, random forest, ripper, na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, ridor, and classification tree, which also consider short DNA sequence fragments of 200 and 300 base pairs (bp). The experimental tests were conducted over 10 real barcode datasets belonging to different animal species, which were provided by the on-line resource "Barcode of Life Database". Results: The experimental results showed that our k-mer-based approach is directly comparable, in terms of accuracy, recall and precision metrics, with the other classifiers when considering full-length sequences. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness of our method when a classification is performed task with a set of short DNA sequences that were randomly extracted from the original data. For example, the proposed method can reach the accuracy of 64.8{\%} at the species level with 200-bp fragments. Under the same conditions, the best other classifier (random forest) reaches the accuracy of 20.9{\%}. Conclusions: Our results indicate that we obtained a clear improvement over the other classifiers for the study of short DNA barcode sequence fragments.},

Many researchers have discussed important factors in knowledge sharing. Nevertheless, the success rate for ISD projects is low and there are other major factors for consideration. Review was conducted to identify potential gaps in existing literature and to explore new factors that impact ISD knowledge sharing in RE. Based on systematic review of literature, two new factors are identified namely Organizational Justice and Social Interdependence. The success of ISD projects are impacted by organizational justice and social interdependence. The proposed theoretical model provides project managers a new platform to further understand ISD knowledge sharing between business users and external IT professionals in RE.},

abstract = {A growing number of researchers are exploring the use of citation relationships such as direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation for information retrieval in scientific databases and digital libraries. In this paper, I propose a method of ranking the relevance of citation-based search results to a set of key, or seed, papers by measuring the number of citation relationships they share with those key papers. I tested the method against 23 published systematic reviews and found that the method retrieved 87{\%} of the studies included in these reviews. The relevance ranking approach identified a subset of the citation search results that comprised 27{\%} of the total documents retrieved by the method, and 7{\%} of the documents retrieved by these reviews, but that contained 75{\%} of the studies included in these reviews. Additional testing suggested that the method may be less appropriate for reviews that combine literature in ways that are not reflected in the literature itself. These results suggest that this ranking method could be useful in a range of information retrieval contexts.},

For the review authors, analysing documents to extract relevant data is a demanding activity. To support the creation of systematic reviews, we have created DASyR-a semi-automatic document analysis system. DASyR is our solution to annotating published papers for the purpose of ontology population. For domains where dictionaries are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing, followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to extend the annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation domain. The reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies makes it a perfect domain to test on. We show the utility of DASyR through experimental results for different parameter values for the bootstrap procedure, evaluated in terms of annotator agreement, error rate, precision and recall.},

It has been 15 years since TREC introduced the first QA track. The principal campaigns in the evaluation of Information Retrieval have been specific tracks focusing on the development and evaluation of this type of system. This study is a brief review of the TREC, CLEF and NTCIR Conferences from the QA perspective. We present a historical overview of 15 years of QA evaluation tracks using the method of systematic review. We have examined identified the different tasks or specific labs created in each QA track, the types of evaluation question used, as well as the evaluation measures used in the different competitions analyzed. Of the conferences, it is CLEF that has applied the greater variety of types of test question (factoid, definition, list, causal, yes/no, amongst others). NTCIR, held on 13 occasions, is the conference which has made use of a greater number of different evaluation measures. Accuracy, precision and recall have been the three most used evaluation measures in the three campaigns. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Objective: To automatically detect duplicate citations in a bibliographical database. Background: Citations retrieved from multiple search databases have different forms making manual and automatic detection of duplicates difficult. Existing methods rely on fuzzy-similarity measures which are error-prone. Methods: We analysed four pairs of original search results from MEDLINE and EMBASE that were used to create systematic reviews. An automatic tool deduplicated citations by first enriching citations with Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), and/or other unique identifiers. Duplication of records was then determined by comparing these unique identifiers. We compared our method with the duplicate detection function of a popular citation management desktop application in several configurations. Results: Citation Enrichment identified 93 {\%} (range 86 {\%}‚Äì100 {\%}) of the duplicates indexed online and erroneously marked 3 {\%} (range 0 {\%}‚Äì6 {\%}) documents as duplicates. The citation management application found 68 {\%} (range 64 {\%}‚Äì72 {\%}) without error using default setting. When set for highest deduplication, the citation management application found 94 {\%} of duplicates (range 77 {\%}‚Äì100 {\%}) and 4 {\%} error (range 0 {\%}‚Äì8 {\%}). Conclusion: Citation enrichment using unique identifiers enhances automatic deduplication. On its own, the approach seems slightly superior to tools that compare citations without enrichment. Methods that combine citation enrichment with existing fuzzy-matching may substantially reduce resource requirements of evidence synthesis.},

abstract = {Objectives: Data extraction from original study reports is a time-consuming, error-prone process in systematic review development. Information extraction (IE) systems have the potential to assist humans in the extraction task, however majority of IE systems were not designed to work on Portable Document Format (PDF) document, an important and common extraction source for systematic review. In a PDF document, narrative content is often mixed with publication metadata or semi-structured text, which add challenges to the underlining natural language processing algorithm. Our goal is to categorize PDF texts for strategic use by IE systems. Methods: We used an open-source tool to extract raw texts from a PDF document and developed a text classification algorithm that follows a multi-pass sieve framework to automatically classify PDF text snippets (for brevity, texts) into TITLE, ABSTRACT, BODYTEXT, SEMISTRUCTURE, and METADATA categories. To validate the algorithm, we developed a gold standard of PDF reports that were included in the development of previous systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration. In a two-step procedure, we evaluated (1) classification performance, and compared it with machine learning classifier, and (2) the effects of the algorithm on an IE system that extracts clinical outcome mentions. Results: The multi-pass sieve algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.6{\%}, which was 9.7{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) higher than the best performing machine learning classifier that used a logistic regression algorithm. F-measure improvements were observed in the classification of TITLE (+15.6{\%}), ABSTRACT (+54.2{\%}), BODYTEXT (+3.7{\%}), SEMISTRUCTURE (+34{\%}), and MEDADATA (+14.2{\%}). In addition, use of the algorithm to filter semi-structured texts and publication metadata improved performance of the outcome extraction system (F-measure +4.1{\%}, p = 0.002). It also reduced of number of sentences to be processed by 44.9{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001), which corresponds to a processing time reduction of 50{\%} (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The rule-based multi-pass sieve framework can be used effectively in categorizing texts extracted from PDF documents. Text classification is an important prerequisite step to leverage information extraction from PDF documents.},

@article{Tian20172245,
abstract = {As cloud computing is getting popular, more and more individuals and organizations are considering outsourcing data to database management systems on public clouds. However, data security and privacy concerns hinder the further adoption of cloud computing and cloud databases. Driven by the needs of data outsourcing and data security on cloud, confidentiality protection for cloud databases has become an important research topic. In this survey, we start by introducing a five-level security model for confidentiality-protected cloud databases, which provides a unified framework for discussing various relevant techniques. This five-level security model identifies five types of security risks: interface risk (level 1), storage risk (level 2), memory data risk (level 3), program state risk (level 4), and access pattern risk (level 5). Among them, the risks from level 3 to level 5 are considered as new challenges in a cloud environment. Then, to address these security risks that are specific to cloud databases, we systematically review and analyze three key data security approaches: querying over encrypted data (level 3), trusted hardware (level 4) and access pattern protection (level 5). Querying over encrypted data can be seen as a specialized form of computation over encrypted data, which has been theoretically solved by fully homomorphic encryption. Unfortunately, all current constructions are too inefficient to be used in practice. However, there are certain kinds of queries can be efficiently processed on encrypted data. For example, range queries can be implemented by either leveraging order-preserving encryption or encrypted indexes. As another example, keyword querying over encrypted data can be efficiently implemented. Regarding the two types of queries, a number of state-of-the-art techniques are described in this paper. The main difficulties of querying over encrypted data are (1) handling arbitrary types of queries over encrypted data and (2) reducing the information leakage. To overcome these drawbacks, it is probably necessary to introduce into cloud environment a special kind of hardware, namely trusted hardware, where user data and computation within are isolated from the outside. Three trusted hardware technologies are described and compared, which are secure coproceesors, FPGAs and Intel SGX. FPGAs and Intel SGX are superior than secure coprocessors in terms of performance and cost, thus more likely to get widely adopted by cloud service providers. While trusted hardware protects the data and computation inside, it reveals its access to the storage outside. It has been shown by several studies that access pattern can leak sensitive information. To reduce information leakage from access pattern, there are two general techniques: private information retrieval and oblivious RAM. The target application scenario of these two techniques are different: the former assumes no encryption of data, while the latter requires encryption. A systematic review on the two techniques are presented in this paper. After reviewing the key techniques of protecting data confidentiality in cloud, we describe and compare the state-of-the-art secure cloud database systems, including those based on cryptography and those based on trusted hardware. Finally, we conclude with perspectives and directions for future research. {\textcopyright} 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose - The main purpose of this article was to investigate the information-seeking behaviour of international students in terms of their information needs and to highlight the role of social media. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a systematic literature survey was conducted in order to investigate information-seeking trends among international students while using social media. As a result, an exhaustive systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out in order to investigate social media as a source for the observation of the behaviours of international students. For this purpose, 71 articles were selected from various well-known sources after an intensive SLR process of searching, filtering, and enforcing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finding - As an outcome of this study, the information-seeking behaviour of international students was highlighted with respect to social media as a source of information. In addition, this research identifies the information needs of the international students and categorises them by the roles played by the social media in fulfilling these. Practical implications - A comparative study that highlighted the dearth of studies which merge social media and information seeking behaviour of international students, as well as identify future directions for research. Originality/value - A detail systematic literature review which highlights the need of shifting the information seeking behaviour from libraries to social media in regard to the new environment for international students.

abstract = {The need to overcome the weaknesses of single estimation techniques for prediction tasks has given rise to ensemble methods in software development effort estimation (SDEE). An ensemble effort estimation (EEE) technique combines several of the single/classical models found in the SDEE literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has yet been performed with a focus on the use of EEE techniques in SDEE. The purpose of this review is to analyze EEE techniques from six viewpoints: single models used to construct ensembles, ensemble estimation accuracy, rules used to combine single estimates, accuracy comparison of EEE techniques with single models, accuracy comparison between EEE techniques and methodologies used to construct ensemble methods. We performed a systematic review of EEE studies published between 2000 and 2016, and we selected 24 of them to address the questions raised in this review. We found that EEE techniques may be separated into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous, and that the machine learning single models are the most frequently employed in constructing EEE techniques. We also found that EEE techniques usually yield acceptable estimation accuracy, and in fact are more accurate than single models.},

Therefore, various techniques have been developed to deal adequately with MV. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was carried out to summarize the existing techniques dealing with MV in SE datasets and to classify the selected studies according to six classification criteria: research type, research approach, MV technique, MV type, data types and MV objective. Publication channels and trends were also identified. As results, 35 papers concerning MV treatments of SE data were selected. This study shows an increasing interest in machine learning (ML) techniques especially the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) to deal with MV in SE datasets and found that most of the MV techniques are used to serve software development effort estimation techniques.},

abstract = {Background:: Statistical validity and model complexity are both important concepts to enhanced understanding and correctness assessment of computational models. However, information about these are often missing from publications applying machine learning. Aim: The aim of this study is to show the importance of providing details that can indicate statistical validity and complexity of models in publications. This is explored in the context of citation screening automation using machine learning techniques. Method: We built 15 Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, each developed using word2vec (average word) features --- and data for 15 review topics from the Drug Evaluation Review Program (DERP) of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Results: The word2vec features were found to be sufficiently linearly separable by the SVM and consequently we used the linear kernels. In 11 of the 15 models, the negative (majority) class used over 80{\%} of its training data as support vectors (SVs) and approximately 45{\%} of the positive training data. Conclusions: In this context, exploring the SVs revealed that the models are overly complex against ideal expectations of not more than 2{\%}-5{\%} (and preferably much less) of the training vectors.},

abstract = {Present paper performs a systematic review conducted to collect evidence on multi tasking and applying cognitive capabilities of robots in complex environments. Different models, architectures, algorithms and approaches were studied and conclusion was drawn. The review was conducted by studying the different scenarios of robots interacting with multiple objects and interfaces considering real time system and multi object environments. The information was collected from various research papers related to multi tasking and cognitive robotics. Twenty five most relevant studies were analyzed. Although many researches have been done on multi tasking in autonomous robots, applying cognition with task switching is still little explored. In the paper we have concluded that multi tasking is more efficient if cognitive intelligence is applied. We have discussed limitations of the existing robotic frame works and models and proposed suggestions to enhance them with natural language interfaces. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent developments and studies in brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies have facilitated emotion detection and classification. Many BCI studies have sought to investigate, detect, and recognize participants' emotional affective states. The applied domains for these studies are varied, and include such fields as communication, education, entertainment, and medicine. To understand trends in electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition system research and to provide practitioners and researchers with insights into and future directions for emotion recognition systems, this study set out to review published articles on emotion detection, recognition, and classification. The study also reviews current and future trends and discusses how these trends may impact researchers and practitioners alike. We reviewed 285 articles, of which 160 were refereed journal articles that were published since the inception of affective computing research. The articles were classified based on a scheme consisting of two categories: research orientation and domains/applications. Our results show considerable growth of EEG-based emotion detection journal publications. This growth reflects an increased research interest in EEG-based emotion detection as a salient and legitimate research area. Such factors as the proliferation of wireless EEG devices, advances in computational intelligence techniques, and machine learning spurred this growth. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {The remarkable advances in biotechnology and health sciences have led to a significant production of data, such as high throughput genetic data and clinical information, generated from large Electronic Health Records (EHRs). To this end, application of machine learning and data mining methods in biosciences is presently, more than ever before, vital and indispensable in efforts to transform intelligently all available information into valuable knowledge. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a group of metabolic disorders exerting significant pressure on human health worldwide. Extensive research in all aspects of diabetes (diagnosis, etiopathophysiology, therapy, etc.) has led to the generation of huge amounts of data. The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review of the applications of machine learning, data mining techniques and tools in the field of diabetes research with respect to a) Prediction and Diagnosis, b) Diabetic Complications, c) Genetic Background and Environment, and e) Health Care and Management with the first category appearing to be the most popular. A wide range of machine learning algorithms were employed. In general, 85{\%} of those used were characterized by supervised learning approaches and 15{\%} by unsupervised ones, and more specifically, association rules. Support vector machines (SVM) arise as the most successful and widely used algorithm. Concerning the type of data, clinical datasets were mainly used. The title applications in the selected articles project the usefulness of extracting valuable knowledge leading to new hypotheses targeting deeper understanding and further investigation in DM.},

Various activities carried out during maintenance include the addition of new features, deletion of obsolete code, correction of errors, etc. Software maintainability means the ease with which these operations can be carried out. If the maintainability can be measured in early phases of the software development, it helps in better planning and optimum resource utilization. Measurement of design properties such as coupling, cohesion, etc. in early phases of development often leads us to derive the corresponding maintainability with the help of prediction models. In this paper, we performed a systematic review of the existing studies related to software maintainability from January 1991 to October 2015.

abstract = {As the demands for big data analytics keep growing rapidly in scientific applications and online services, MapReduce and its open-source implementation Hadoop gained popularity in both academia and enterprises. Hadoop provides a highly feasible solution for building big data analytics platforms. However, defects of Hadoop are also exposed in many aspects including data management, resource management, scheduling policies, etc. These issues usually cause high energy consumption when running MapReduce jobs in Hadoop clusters. In this paper, we review the studies on improving energy efficiency of Hadoop clusters and summarize them in five categories including the energy-aware cluster node management, energy-aware data management, energy-aware resource allocation, energy-aware task scheduling and other energy-saving schemes. For each category, we briefly illustrate its rationale and comparatively analyze the relevant works regarding their advantages and limitations. Moreover, we present our insights and figure out possible research directions including energy-efficient cluster partitioning, data-oriented resource classification and provisioning, resource provisioning based on optimal utilization, EE and locality aware task scheduling, optimizing job profiling with machine learning, elastic power-saving Hadoop with containerization and efficient big data analytics on Hadoop. On one hand, the summary of studies on energy-efficient Hadoop presented in this paper provides useful guidance for the developers and users to better utilize Hadoop. On the other hand, the insights and research trends discussed in this work may inspire the relevant research on improving the energy efficiency of Hadoop in big data analytics. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Systematic review, a form of evidence synthesis that critically appraises existing studies on the same topic and synthesizes study results, helps reduce the evidence gap. However, keeping the systematic review up-to-date is a great challenge partly due to the difficulty in interpreting the conclusion of a systematic review. A promising approach to this challenge is to make semantic representation of the claims made in both the systematic review and the included studies it synthesizes so that it's possible to automatically predict whether the conclusion of a systematic review changes given a new study. In this dissertation work, we developed a taxonomy to represent knowledge claims both in systematic review and its included studies with the goal of automatically updating a systematic review. We then developed machine learning models to automatically predict a synthesized claim from claims in individual studies.},

abstract = {Objective: The amount of information for clinicians and clinical researchers is growing exponentially. Text summarization reduces information as an attempt to enable users to find and understand relevant source texts more quickly and effortlessly. In recent years, substantial research has been conducted to develop and evaluate various summarization techniques in the biomedical domain. The goal of this study was to systematically review recent published research on summarization of textual documents in the biomedical domain. Materials and methods: MEDLINE (2000 to October 2013), IEEE Digital Library, and the ACM digital library were searched. Investigators independently screened and abstracted studies that examined text summarization techniques in the biomedical domain. Information is derived from selected articles on five dimensions: input, purpose, output, method and evaluation. Results: Of 10,786 studies retrieved, 34 (0.3{\%}) met the inclusion criteria. Natural language processing (17; 50{\%}) and a hybrid technique comprising of statistical, Natural language processing and machine learning (15; 44{\%}) were the most common summarization approaches. Most studies (28; 82{\%}) conducted an intrinsic evaluation. Discussion: This is the first systematic review of text summarization in the biomedical domain. The study identified research gaps and provides recommendations for guiding future research on biomedical text summarization. Conclusion: Recent research has focused on a hybrid technique comprising statistical, language processing and machine learning techniques. Further research is needed on the application and evaluation of text summarization in real research or patient care settings.},

@article{Guan2010,
abstract = {An ultimate goal of genetic research is to understand the connection between genotype and phenotype in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The quantitative genetics field has developed a suite of statistical methods to associate genetic loci with diseases and phenotypes, including quantitative trait loci (QTL) linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, each of these approaches have technical and biological shortcomings. For example, the amount of heritable variation explained by GWAS is often surprisingly small and the resolution of many QTL linkage mapping studies is poor. The predictive power and interpretation of QTL and GWAS results are consequently limited. In this study, we propose a complementary approach to quantitative genetics by interrogating the vast amount of high-throughput genomic data in model organisms to functionally associate genes with phenotypes and diseases. Our algorithm combines the genome-wide functional relationship network for the laboratory mouse and a state-of-the-art machine learning method. We demonstrate the superior accuracy of this algorithm through predicting genes associated with each of 1157 diverse phenotype ontology terms. Comparison between our prediction results and a meta-analysis of quantitative genetic studies reveals both overlapping candidates and distinct, accurate predictions uniquely identified by our approach. Focusing on bone mineral density (BMD), a phenotype related to osteoporotic fracture, we experimentally validated two of our novel predictions (not observed in any previous GWAS/QTL studies) and found significant bone density defects for both Timp2 and Abcg8 deficient mice. Our results suggest that the integration of functional genomics data into networks, which itself is informative of protein function and interactions, can successfully be utilized as a complementary approach to quantitative genetics to predict disease risks.

abstract = {Background: The popularity and proliferation of online social networks (OSNs) have created massive social interaction among users that generate an extensive amount of data. An OSN offers a unique opportunity for studying and understanding social interaction and communication among far larger populations now more than ever before. Recently, OSNs have received considerable attention as a possible tool to track a pandemic because they can provide an almost real-time surveillance system at a less costly rate than traditional surveillance systems. Methods: A systematic literature search for studies with the primary aim of using OSN to detect and track a pandemic was conducted. We conducted an electronic literature search for eligible English articles published between 2004 and 2015 using PUBMED, IEEExplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. First, the articles were screened on the basis of titles and abstracts. Second, the full texts were reviewed. All included studies were subjected to quality assessment. Result: OSNs have rich information that can be utilized to develop an almost real-time pandemic surveillance system. The outcomes of OSN surveillance systems have demonstrated high correlations with the findings of official surveillance systems. However, the limitation in using OSN to track pandemic is in collecting representative data with sufficient population coverage. This challenge is related to the characteristics of OSN data. The data are dynamic, large-sized, and unstructured, thus requiring advanced algorithms and computational linguistics. Conclusions: OSN data contain significant information that can be used to track a pandemic. Different from traditional surveys and clinical reports, in which the data collection process is time consuming at costly rates, OSN data can be collected almost in real time at a cheaper cost. Additionally, the geographical and temporal information can provide exploratory analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease spread. However, on one hand, an OSN-based surveillance system requires comprehensive adoption, enhanced geographical identification system, and advanced algorithms and computational linguistics to eliminate its limitations and challenges. On the other hand, OSN is probably to never replace traditional surveillance, but it can offer complementary data that can work best when integrated with traditional data.},

For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90{\%} of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.},

abstract = {The number of scientific publications is constantly increasing, and the results published on Empirical Software Engineering are growing even faster. Some software engineering publishers have began to collaborate with research groups to make available repositories of software engineering empirical data. However, these initiatives are limited due to issues related to the available search tools. As a result, many researchers in the area have adopted a semi-automated approach for performing searches for systematic reviews as a mean to extract empirical evidence from published material. This makes this activity labor intensive and error prone. In this paper, we argue that the use of techniques from information retrieval, as well as text mining, can support systematic reviews and improve the creation of repositories of SE empirical evidence.},

abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of 840 SIGIR full papers and 215 TOIS papers published between 2006 and 2015. The original objective of the study was to identify IR effectiveness experiments that are seriously underpowered (i.e., the sample size is far too small so that the probability of missing a real difference is extremely high) or overpowered (i.e., the sample size is so large that a difference will be considered statistically significant even if the actual effect size is extremely small). However, it quickly became clear to us that many IR effectiveness papers either lack significance testing or fail to report p-values and/or test statistics, which prevents us from conducting power analysis. Hence we first report on how IR researchers (fail to) report on significance test results, what types of tests they use, and how the reporting practices may have changed over the last decade. From those papers that reported enough information for us to conduct power analysis, we identify extremely overpowered and underpowered experiments, as well as appropriate sample sizes for future experiments. The raw results of our systematic survey of 1,055 papers and our R scripts for power analysis are available online. Our hope is that this study will help improve the reporting practices and experimental designs of future IR effectiveness studies.},

Link-context has been applied in areas such as search engines, focused crawlers, and automatic classification. Therefore, extraction of precise link-context may be considered as an important parameter for extracting more relevant information from the web-page. In this paper, we have proposed a rule-based approach for the extraction of the link-context from anchor-text (AT) structure using bottom-up simple LR (SLR) parser. Here, we have considered only named entity (NE) anchor-text. In order to validate our proposed approach, we have considered a sample of 4 ATs. The results have shown that, the proposed LCEA has extracted 100{\%} actual link-context of each considered AT. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Remote sensing image segmentation requiresmulti-category classification typically with limited number of labeled training samples. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a sub-field of machine learning to tackle the scarcity of labeled samples, most SSL algorithms to date have had trade-offs in terms of scalability and/or applicability to multi-categorical data. In this paper, we evaluate semi-supervised logistic regression (SLR), a recent information theoretic semi-supervised algorithm, for remote sensing image classification problems. SLR is a probabilistic discriminative classifier and a specific instance of the generalizedmaximumentropy framework with a convex loss function. Moreover, the method is inherently multi-class and easy to implement. These characteristics make SLR a strong alternative to the widely used semi-supervised variants of SVMfor the segmentation of remote sensing images. We demonstrate the competitiveness of SLR in multispectral, hyperspectral and radar image classification. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

This task can speed up learning algorithms and sometimes improve their performance. In multi-label learning, label dependence is considered another aspect that can contribute to improve learning performance. A replicable and wide systematic review performed by us corroborates this idea. Based on this information, it is believed that considering label dependence during feature selection can lead to better learning performance. The hypothesis of this work is that multi-label feature selection algorithms that consider label dependence will perform better than the ones that disregard it. To this end, we propose multi-label feature selection algorithms that take into account label relations. These algorithms were experimentally compared to the standard approach for feature selection, showing good performance in terms of feature reduction and predictability of the classifiers built using the selected features.},

abstract = {The Repository of Assigned Search Tasks (RepAST) is a searchable repository created through a systematic review of the interactive information retrieval (IIR) research literature. It currently contains bibliographic details for approximately 750 articles, including empirical studies that employ assigned search tasks and a smaller number of conceptual papers on task-based searching. When available, the search task types, definitions and the task descriptions themselves are included. RepAST makes several contributions to the field. By bringing together examples of search task descriptions used in actual studies, RepAST provides a platform for studying practices within the research community and promoting greater conceptual clarity and consensus in the use of search tasks. To this end, the authors have published several studies based on analyses of the search tasks in the repository. In addition, researchers can use RepAST in a practical way, as a source of search task descriptions for reuse in new studies or in order to replicate prior research. In this interactive demo session, participants will have the opportunity to use the live RepAST system and provide feedback to the system designers.},

abstract = {We have explored the potential of using side effect profiles of drugs to predict their bioactivities at the receptor level. Serotonin 5-HT6 binding and dopamine antagonism were investigated in separate studies. A set of 5-HT6 binders and non-binders was retrieved from the PDSP Ki database, whereas dopamine antagonists were retrieved from the MeSH Pharmaceutical Action file. The side effect data was extracted from ChemoText, a data repository containing MeSH annotations pulled from MEDLINE records. These side effects profiles were treated as molecular descriptors enabling a QSAR-like approach to build models that could reliably discriminate different classes of molecules, e.g., binders versus non-binders, and dopamine antagonists versus non-antagonists. Selected models with the best external prediction performances were applied to a library of ca. 1000 chemicals with known side effects profiles in order to predict their potential 5-HT6 binding and/or dopamine antagonism. In each case the virtual screening process was able to identify putatively active compounds that through subsequent literature-based validation were found to be likely or known 5-HT6 binders or dopamine antagonists. These results demonstrate that side effect profiles can be utilized to predict a drug's unknown molecular activity, thus representing a valuable opportunity in repositioning the drug for a new indications.},

abstract = {Observational evidence in clinical practice is critical in healthcare and policy making. Researchers spend a lot of time searching for relevant published articles to write a systematic review of a topic. In this paper, we present our participation as the team of IIIT Hyderabad at Task2 Technologically Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine as an effort to automate this task and deliver relevant information in medical literature. We base our approach on query expansion according to relevance feedback. Query expansion is a standard technique in information retrieval tasks with growing use in medical literature [1, 2]. Articles returned from pubmed query performed during a systematic review are first indexed using lucene's inverted index. The query is porcessed for term boosting, fuzzy search and used for scoring documents according to TF-IDF similarity. Relevance feedback is used to update the query and become more pragmatic.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a complex progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder, being its prevalence expected to rise over the next decades. Unconventional strategies for elucidating the genetic mechanisms are necessary due to its polygenic nature. In this work, the input information sources are five: a public DNA microarray that measures expression levels of control and patient samples, repositories of known genes associated to Alzheimer's disease, additional data, Gene Ontology and finally, a literature review or expert knowledge to validate the results. As methodology to identify genes highly related to this disease, we present the integration of three machine learning techniques: particularly, we have used decision trees, quantitative association rules and hierarchical cluster to analyze Alzheimer's disease gene expression profiles to identify genes highly linked to this neurodegenerative disease, through changes in their expression levels between control and patient samples. We propose an ensemble of decision trees and quantitative association rules to find the most suitable configurations of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm GarNet, in order to overcome the complex parametrization intrinsic to this type of algorithms. To fulfill this goal, GarNet has been executed using multiple configuration settings and the well-known C4.5 has been used to find the minimum accuracy to be satisfied. Then, GarNet is rerun to identify dependencies between genes and their expression levels, so we are able to distinguish between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients using the configurations that overcome the minimum threshold of accuracy defined by C4.5 algorithm. Finally, a hierarchical cluster analysis has been used to validate the obtained gene-Alzheimer's Disease associations provided by GarNet. The results have shown that the obtained rules were able to successfully characterize the underlying information, grouping relevant genes for Alzheimer Disease. The genes reported by our approach provided two well defined groups that perfectly divided the samples between healthy and Alzheimer's Disease patients. To prove the relevance of the obtained results, a statistical test and gene expression fold-change were used. Furthermore, this relevance has been summarized in a volcano plot, showing two clearly separated and significant groups of genes that are up or down-regulated in Alzheimer's Disease patients. A biological knowledge integration phase was performed based on the information fusion of systematic literature review, enrichment Gene Ontology terms for the described genes found in the hippocampus of patients. Finally, a validation phase with additional data and a permutation test is carried out, being the results consistent with previous studies.},

abstract = {Millions of people around the world suffer from pain, acute or chronic and this raises the importance of its screening, assessment and treatment. Pain, is highly subjective and the use of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can play an important part in improving the accuracy of pain assessment, and lead to better clinical practices. This review examines CDSSs, in relation to computer technologies and was conducted with the following electronic databases: CiteSeerx, IEEE Xplore, ISI Web of Knowledge, Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search, PubMed, Science Accelerator, Science.gov, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and The Cochrane Library. The studies referenced were compiled with several criteria in mind. Firstly, that they constituted a decision support system. Secondly, that study data included pain values or results based on the detection of pain. Thirdly, that they were published in English, between 1992 and 2011, and finally that they focused on patients with acute or chronic pain. In total, thirty-nine studies highlighted the following topics: rule based algorithms, artificial neural networks, rough and fuzzy sets, statistical learning algorithms, terminologies, questionnaires and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53{\%} to 87.5{\%}. The lack of integration with mobile devices, the limited use of web-based interfaces and the scarcity of systems that allow for data to be inserted by patients were all limitations that were detected. {\textcopyright} 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.},

Due to significant variation points in previous studies, results are not easily aggregated. Aim. We aim at an overview picture of the outcome of previous evaluations. Method. Based on a systematic mapping study, we perform a synthesis of published research. Results. Our synthesis shows that there are no empirical evidence that any IR model outperforms another model consistently. We also display a strong dependency between the Precision and Recall (P-R) values and the input datasets. Finally, our mapping of P-R values on the possible output space highlights the difficulty of recovering accurate trace links using naiÃàve cut-off strategies. Conclusion. Based on our findings, we stress the need for empirical evaluations beyond the basic P-R 'race'.},

abstract = {To get a better prediction of costs, schedule, and the risks of a software project, it is necessary to have a more accurate prediction of its development effort. Among the main prediction techniques are those based on mathematical models, such as statistical regressions or machine learning (ML). The ML models applied to predicting the development effort have mainly based their conclusions on the following weaknesses: (1) using an accuracy criterion which leads to asymmetry, (2) applying a validation method that causes a conclusion instability by randomly selecting the samples for training and testing the models, (3) omitting the explanation of how the parameters for the neural networks were determined, (4) generating conclusions from models that were not trained and tested from mutually exclusive data sets, (5) omitting an analysis of the dependence, variance and normality of data for selecting the suitable statistical test for comparing the accuracies among models, and (6) reporting results without showing a statistically signi ficant difference. In this study, these six issues are addressed when comparing the prediction accuracy of a radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) with that of a regression statistical (the model most frequently compared with ML models), to feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP, the most commonly used in the effort prediction of software projects), and to general regression neural network (GRNN, a RBFNN variant). The hypothesis tested is the following: the accuracy of effort prediction for RBFNN is statistically better than the accuracy obtained from a simple linear regression (SLR), MLP and GRNN when adjusted function points data, obtained from software projects, is used as the independent variable. Samples obtained from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) Release 11 related to new and enhanced projects were used. The models were trained and tested from a leave-one-out cross-validation method. The criteria for evaluating the models were based on Absolute Residuals and by a Friedman statistical test. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the accuracy among the four models for new projects, but not for enhanced projects. Regarding new projects, the accuracy for RBFNN was better than for a SLR at the 99{\%} confidence level, whereas the MLP and GRNN were better than for a SLR at the 90{\%} confidence level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A wealth of information on clinical trials has been provided by publicly accessible online registries. Information technology and data exchange standards enable rapid extraction, summarization, and visualization of information and derived knowledge from these data sets. Clinical trials data was extracted in the XML format from the National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov site. This data includes categories such as 'Summary of Purpose', 'Trial Sponsor', 'Phase of the Trial', 'Recruiting Status', and 'Location'. We focused on 645 clinical trials related to cancer vaccines. Additional facts on cancer types, including incidence and survival rates, were retrieved from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This application enables rapid extraction of information about institutions, diseases, clinical approaches, clinical trials dates, predominant cancer types in the trials, clinical opportunities and pharmaceutical market coverage. Presentation of results is facilitated by visualization tools that summarize the landscape of ongoing and completed cancer vaccine trials. Our summaries show the number of clinical vaccine trials per cancer type, over time, by phase, by lead sponsors, as well as trial activity relative to cancer type and survival data. We also have identified cancers that are neglected in the cancer vaccine field: bladder, liver, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and all of the low-incidence cancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We have developed a data mining approach that enables rapid extraction of complex data from the major clinical trial repository. Summarization and visualization of these data represents a cost-effective means of making informed decisions about future cancer vaccine clinical trials.},

abstract = {This work presents a systematic review of techniques for the 3D automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in computerized-tomography (CT) images. Its main goals are to analyze the latest technology being used for the development of computational diagnostic tools to assist in the acquisition, storage and, mainly, processing and analysis of the biomedical data. Also, this work identifies the progress made, so far, evaluates the challenges to be overcome and provides an analysis of future prospects. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that a review is devoted exclusively to automated 3D techniques for the detection of pulmonary nodules from lung CT images, which makes this work of noteworthy value. The research covered the published works in the Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct and IEEEXplore up to December 2014. Each work found that referred to automated 3D segmentation of the lungs was individually analyzed to identify its objective, methodology and results. Based on the analysis of the selected works, several studies were seen to be useful for the construction of medical diagnostic aid tools. However, there are certain aspects that still require attention such as increasing algorithm sensitivity, reducing the number of false positives, improving and optimizing the algorithm detection of different kinds of nodules with different sizes and shapes and, finally, the ability to integrate with the Electronic Medical Record Systems and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems. Based on this analysis, we can say that further research is needed to develop current techniques and that new algorithms are needed to overcome the identified drawbacks.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the value of using a systematic literature review to develop an integrated framework for information and knowledge management systems. Design/methodology/approach First, the systematic literature review method is introduced, differentiating it from traditional literature reviews in terms of value-added and limitations. Second, this methodology is used in a research application focused on absorptive capacity internal capabilities with regard to the processes of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Third, an integrated framework for information and knowledge management systems is developed from this application. Findings The systematic literature review approach provides a rigor that can assist in reducing researcher bias while simultaneously enabling the definition of a precise scope of review, with a clear explanation of selection criteria with the objective to find and review all the studies that are relevant to the search definitions. As a research method, it effectively supports a qualitative, quantitative or mixed methodology. Research limitations/implications This methodology was applied to one specific area of research. Specific limitations include the availability of articles in subscribed databases and the analytical capabilities of the tools used for text mining and analytics. Originality/value This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the systematic literature review methodology in developing an integrated framework for analysis.},

abstract = {We followed a systematic approach based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to identify existing clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems that generate structured information from unstructured free text. Seven literature databases were searched with a query combining the concepts of natural language processing and structured data capture. Two reviewers screened all records for relevance during two screening phases, and information about clinical NLP systems was collected from the final set of papers. A total of 7149 records (after removing duplicates) were retrieved and screened, and 86 were determined to fit the review criteria. These papers contained information about 71 different clinical NLP systems, which were then analyzed. The NLP systems address a wide variety of important clinical and research tasks. Certain tasks are well addressed by the existing systems, while others remain as open challenges that only a small number of systems attempt, such as extraction of temporal information or normalization of concepts to standard terminologies. This review has identified many NLP systems capable of processing clinical free text and generating structured output, and the information collected and evaluated here will be important for prioritizing development of new approaches for clinical NLP.},

A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Primary outcome measures were the requirement for re-operation, postoperative mortality and postoperative dysphagia. Secondary outcome measures were operative time, length of hospital stay, operative complications and cost. Six randomized trials, of 226 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in requirement for re-operation or in postoperative dysphagia. There was a significantly reduced total operative time in the laparoscopic group (weighted mean difference = 4.154; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI = 1.932-6.375; p = 0.0002). There was no significant difference between robotic and laparoscopic groups for hospital stay or operative complications. Clinical results from robotic Nissen fundoplication were comparable to the standard laparoscopic approach, but there was associated increased operative time and procedure cost.

@article{Olier201750,
abstract = {In this work, the problems of knowledge acquisition and information processing are explored in relation to the definitions of concepts and conceptual processing, and their implications for artificial agents. The discussion focuses on views of cognition as a dynamic property in which the world is actively represented in grounded mental states which only have meaning in the action context. Reasoning is understood as an emerging property consequence of actions-environment couplings achieved through experience, and concepts as situated and dynamic phenomena enabling behaviours. Re-framing the characteristics of concepts is considered crucial to overcoming settled beliefs and reinterpreting new understandings in artificial systems. The first part presents a review of concepts from cognitive sciences. Support is found for views on grounded and embodied cognition, describing concepts as dynamic, flexible, context-dependent, and distributedly coded. That is argued to contrast with many technical implementations assuming concepts as categories, whilst explains limitations when grounding amodal symbols, or in unifying learning, perception and reasoning. The characteristics of concepts are linked to methods of active inference, self-organization, and deep learning to address challenges posed and to reinterpret emerging techniques. In a second part, an architecture based on deep generative models is presented to illustrate arguments elaborated. It is evaluated in a navigation task, showing that sufficient representations are created regarding situated behaviours with no semantics imposed on data. Moreover, adequate behaviours are achieved through a dynamic integration of perception and action in a single representational domain and process.},

abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to present an overview of the challenges encountered in integrating visual search interfaces into digital libraries and repositories. These challenges come in various forms, including information visualisation, the use of knowledge organisation systems and metadata quality. The main purpose of this study is the identification of criteria for the evaluation and integration of visual search interfaces, proposing guidelines and recommendations to improve information retrieval tasks with emphasis on the education-al context.Design/methodology/approach The information included in this study was collected based on a systematic literature review approach. The main information sources were explored in several digital libraries, including Science Direct, Scopus, ACM and IEEE, and include journal articles, conference proceedings, books, European project reports and deliverables and PhD theses published in an electronic format. A total of 142 studies comprised the review.Findings There are several issues that authors did not fully discuss in this literature review study; more specific, aspects associated with access of digital resources in digital libraries and repositories based on human computer interaction, i.e. usability and learnability of user interfaces; design of a suitable navigation method of search based on simple knowledge organisation schemes; and the use of usefulness of visual search interfaces to locate relevant resources.Research limitations/implications The main steps for carrying out a systematic review are drawn from health care; this methodology is not commonly used in fields such as digital libraries and repositories. The authors aimed to apply the fundamentals of the systematic literature review methodology considering the context of this study. Additionally, there are several aspects of accessibility that were not considered in the study, such as accessibility to content for disabled people as defined by ISO/IEC 40500:2012.Originality/value No other systematic literature reviews have been conducted in this field. The research presents an in-depth analysis of the criteria associated with searching and navigation methods based on the systematic literature review approach. The analysis is relevant for researchers in the field of digital library and repository creation in that it may direct them to considerations in designing and implementing visual search interfaces based on the use of information visualisation.},

abstract = {When trying to synthesize information from multiple sources and perform a statistical review to compare them, particularly in the medical research field, several statistical tools are available, most common are the systematic review and the meta-analysis. These techniques allow the comparison of the effectiveness or success among a group of studies. However, a problem of these tools is that if the information to be compared is incomplete or mismatched between two or more studies, the comparison becomes an arduous task. On a parallel line, machine learning methodologies have been proven to be a reliable resource, such software is developed to classify several variables and learn from previous experiences to improve the classification. In this paper, we use unsupervised machine learning methodologies to describe a simple yet effective algorithm that, given a dataset with missing data, completes such data, which leads to a more complete systematic review and metaanalysis, capable of presenting a final effectiveness or success rating between studies. Our method is first validated in a movie ranking database scenario, and then used in a real life systematic review and metaanalysis of obesity prevention scientific papers, where 66.6{\%} of the outcomes are missing.},

In order to enable everyone to access this medium, Web accessibility has become an emerging topic, and many techniques have been evolved to support the development of accessible Web content. This paper presents a survey on techniques for Web accessibility and proposes a classification into the processes of ISO/IEC 12207 standard. The survey was carried out applying systematic review principles during the literature review. The results include analysis obtained from the synthesis of 53 studies, selected from an initial set of 844. Although the survey results indicate a growth in research on techniques for design and evaluation of Web applications, they also indicate that several development activities have been poorly addressed by scientific research efforts.},

abstract = {Context: Software fault prediction has been an important research topic in the software engineering field for more than 30 years. Software defect prediction models are commonly used to detect faulty software modules based on software metrics collected during the software development process. Objective: Data mining techniques and machine learning studies in the fault prediction software context are mapped and characterized. We investigated the metrics and techniques and their performance according to performance metrics studied. An analysis and synthesis of these studies is conducted. Method: A systematic mapping study has been conducted for identifying and aggregating evidence about software fault prediction. Results: About 70 studies published from January 2002 to December 2014 were identified. Top 40 studies were selected for analysis, based on the quality criteria results. The main metrics used were: Halstead, McCabe and LOC (67.14{\%}), Halstead, McCabe and LOC + Object-Oriented (15.71{\%}), others (17.14{\%}). The main models were: Machine Learning(ML) (47.14{\%}), ML + Statistical Analysis (31.42{\%}), others (21.41{\%}). The data sets used were: private access (35{\%}) and public access (65{\%}). The most frequent combination of metrics, models and techniques were: Halstead, McCabe and LOC + Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree representing the (60{\%}) of the analyzed studies. Conclusions: This article has identified and classified the performance of the metrics, techniques and their combinations. This will help researchers to select datasets, metrics and models based on experimental results, with the objective to generate learning schemes that allow a better prediction software failures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The health sciences literature incorporates a relatively large subset of epidemiological studies that focus on population-level findings, including various determinants, outcomes and correlations. Extracting structured information about those characteristics would be useful for more complete understanding of diseases and for meta-analyses and systematic reviews.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present an information extraction approach that enables users to identify key characteristics of epidemiological studies from MEDLINE abstracts. It extracts six types of epidemiological characteristic: design of the study, population that has been studied, exposure, outcome, covariates and effect size. We have developed a generic rule-based approach that has been designed according to semantic patterns observed in text, and tested it in the domain of obesity. Identified exposure, outcome and covariate concepts are clustered into health-related groups of interest. On a manually annotated test corpus of 60 epidemiological abstracts, the system achieved precision, recall and F-score between 79-100{\%}, 80-100{\%} and 82-96{\%} respectively. We report the results of applying the method to a large scale epidemiological corpus related to obesity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The experiments suggest that the proposed approach could identify key epidemiological characteristics associated with a complex clinical problem from related abstracts. When integrated over the literature, the extracted data can be used to provide a more complete picture of epidemiological efforts, and thus support understanding via meta-analysis and systematic reviews.},

abstract = {In multi-label learning, each instance is associated with multiple labels, which are often correlated. As other machine learning tasks, multi-label learning also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which can be mitigated by feature selection. This work experimentally evaluates four multi-label feature selection algorithms that use the filter approach. Three of them are based on the ReliefF algorithm, which takes into account interacting features. The quality of the selected features is assessed by three different learning algorithms. Evaluating multilabel learning algorithms is a complicated task, as multiple evaluation measures, which might optimize different loss functions, should be considered. To this end, GeneralB, a baseline algorithm which learns by only looking at the multi-labels of the dataset, is used as a reference. Results show that feature selection contributed to improve the performance of classifiers initially worse than GeneralB and highlight ReliefFbased algorithms in some experimental settings. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

A systematic review of literature from 2004 to 2014 was conducted using nine relevant databases, which yielded 42 quantitative studies, which were analyzed. The analysis revealed that information seeking behavior varied by age, gender, health status, education, socio-economic status and technology literacy. Over time, there has been a gradual increase in the use of the Internet by senior citizens seeking health information. Also, there has been a corresponding increase in a number of intervention studies in e-health literacy for senior citizens. Shortcomings in the literature include compromised methodological issues of inadequately powered sample size, absence of longitudinal and theory-based studies, and dearth of research on relevant outcomes. The article ends with a discussion of the relevance of the findings to IL researchers and practitioners, and suggestions for further research.},

abstract = {Adequate grasping force estimation and slip detection is a vital problem in wider applications of robots and manipulators in industries as well as in our everyday life. In this paper, a new methodology for slip detection during grasping by robot grippers/end-effectors using tactile sensor has been presented. During the object slippage, the tactile sensor in touch with the object surface travels along the peaks and valleys of surface texture of the object which creates vibratory motions in the tactile. A newly developed mathematical model is used to compute the scattered energy of vibrations, which contains parameters of surface texture geometry as well as trial grasping force, and other relevant parameters. Using the scattered energy of vibrations predicted by soft computing techniques, an attempt to instantly estimate the adequate grasping force has been reasonably successful. Surface texture data, for experimental estimation of grasping force, were collected from a huge number of machined specimens and were used to build four different machine learning estimation techniques. Experimental results using Linear Regression (LR), Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Pace Regression (PR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrate a relatively better technique for industrial applications.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop high-performance early sepsis prediction technology for the general patient population. Methods: Retrospective analysis of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (from the MIMIC II dataset) who were not septic at the time of admission. Results: A sepsis early warning algorithm, InSight, was developed and applied to the prediction of sepsis up to three hours prior to a patient's first five hour Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) episode. When applied to a never-before-seen set of test patients, InSight predictions demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.90 (95{\%} CI: 0.89-0.91) and a specificity of 0.81 (95{\%} CI: 0.80-0.82), exceeding or rivaling that of existing biomarker detection methods. Across predictive times up to three hours before a sustained SIRS event, InSight maintained an average area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (95{\%} CI: 0.80-0.86). Analysis of patient sepsis risk showed that contributions from the coevolution of multiple risk factors were more important than the contributions from isolated individual risk factors when making predictions further in advance. Conclusions: Sepsis can be predicted at least three hours in advance of onset of the first five hour SIRS episode, using only nine commonly available vital signs, with better performance than methods in standard practice today. High-order correlations of vital sign measurements are key to this prediction, which improves the likelihood of early identification of at-risk patients.},

abstract = {Context: Personnel assignment (PA) is an important problem in industry. In general it is about assigning the right people to the right tasks. Operations research plays a big role in solving such problems. Objective: In this paper, we study the personnel assignment problem (PAP) and the proposed solutions to solve it. In addition to that, we aim to identify promising future works from the study results. Methods: We take a systematic approach towards studying the literature of the PAP. A general systematic review method, which has been recently used by a number of researchers in the field of software engineering, was modified and deployed in this study. Results: The analysis results reveal potential solution approaches, the trends in application of existing solution methods, and some potential future research areas. The review process is based on our variation of an existing literature review method. This variation is also presented in the paper. Conclusions: Although a concern in industry, PAP has not been widely studied when compared to other similar fields of research. It has been mainly studied in operations research and in the context of military personnel assignments. It seems that artificial intelligence and machine learning still have a good potential to contribute to this field of research in different applications. Application of PAP in software engineering (SE) is an open area of research. For instance, it looks promising for developer or bug assignments in software development projects.},

@article{Qaiser20171376,
abstract = {Purpose - Decision making in logistics is an increasingly complex task for organizations as these involve decisions at strategic, tactical and operational levels coupled with the triple-bottom line of sustainability. Decision support systems (DSS) played a vital role in arguably solving the challenges associated with decision making in sustainable logistics. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of the research in the domain of DSS for logistics while considering sustainability aspects. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review approach using a set of relevant keywords with several exclusion criteria was adopted to identify literature related to DSS for sustainable logistics. A total of 40 papers were found from 1994 to 2015, which were then analyzed along the dimensions of publishing trend, geographic distribution and collaboration, the most influential journals, affiliations and authors as well as the key themes of identified literature. The analysis was conducted by means of bibliometric and text mapping tools, namely BibExcel, gpsvisualizer and VOSviewer. Findings - The bibliometric analysis showed that DSS for sustainable logistics is an emerging field; however, it is still evolving but at a slower pace. Furthermore, most of the contributing affiliations belong to the USA and the UK. The text mining and keyword analysis revealed key themes of identified papers. The inherent key themes were decision models and frameworks to address sustainable logistics issues covering transport, distribution and third-party logistics. The most prominent sustainable logistics issue was carbon footprinting. Social impact has been given less attention in comparison to economic and environmental aspects. The literature has adequate room for proposing more effective solutions by considering various types of multi-criteria decision analysis methods and DSS configurations while simultaneously considering economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainable logistics. Moreover, the field has potential to include logistics from wide application areas including freight transport through road, rail, sea, air as well as inter-modal transport, port operations, material handling and warehousing. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review of DSS for sustainable logistics using bibliometric and text analysis. The key themes and research gaps identified in this paper will provide a reference point that will encourage and guide interested researchers for future study, thus aiding both theoretical and practical advancements in this discipline.},

abstract = {Background: Research literature in biomedicine and related fields contains a huge number of claims, such as the effectiveness of treatments. These claims are not always consistent and may even contradict each other. Being able to identify contradictory claims is important for those who rely on the biomedical literature. Automated methods to identify and resolve them are required to cope with the amount of information available. However, research in this area has been hampered by a lack of suitable resources. We describe a methodology to develop a corpus which addresses this gap by providing examples of potentially contradictory claims and demonstrate how it can be applied to identify these claims from Medline abstracts related to the topic of cardiovascular disease. Methods: A set of systematic reviews concerned with four topics in cardiovascular disease were identified from Medline and analysed to determine whether the abstracts they reviewed contained contradictory research claims. For each review, annotators were asked to analyse these abstracts to identify claims within them that answered the question addressed in the review. The annotators were also asked to indicate how the claim related to that question and the type of the claim. Results: A total of 259 abstracts associated with 24 systematic reviews were used to form the corpus. Agreement between the annotators was high, suggesting that the information they provided is reliable. Conclusions: The paper describes a methodology for constructing a corpus containing contradictory research claims from the biomedical literature. The corpus is made available to enable further research into this area and support the development of automated approaches to contradiction identification. {\textcopyright} 2016 Alamri and Stevenson.},

abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is an information-based process throughout which each stage must be carefully and systematically designed in planning phase. Important decisions need to be made about the various choices involved in the SLR planning phase. However, due to the necessarily comprehensive and rigorous nature of SLR, many researchers have difficulties in planning SLRs sufficiently and effectively. In recent decades, the use of text mining (TM) techniques has been introduced to facilitate SLR process, especially at conducting review phase to support the searching and selection of studies. However, so far, TM techniques have not been applied to support any activities during SLR planning phase. In this research, we proposed a method that apply Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) method to support decision-making activities within the SLR planning phase. This method also known as SLR Planning Based on Suffix Tree Clustering (SLRP-STC) method. It aims to help reviewers in three ways: 1) to extract research topics easily; 2) to better interpret extracted information; and 3) to quickly realize and refine a proposed search string that is poorly formulated or inappropriate. A case study was conducted by comparing the proposed method with manual approach. It is observed that the use of SLRP-STC method can improve the planning of SLR.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a structured way of conducting a review that can assist the researcher in analyzing the progress of a specific stream of research. Although there are a number of SLR guidelines proposed by existing researchers, there is still too little attention paid to the approach taken and the tools that could be applied throughout the SLR process. Therefore, this paper attempted to fill the gap by presenting the application of Data Analytics approach in the SLR with the utilization of data mining and text mining technique. It proposed a step-by-step procedure using data analytics approach, and recommended tools to be used in the SLR process. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, the authors selected a Master Data Management research domain as a case study. Based on this particular application, it can be concluded that this approach is a replicable, effective and output-based approach in conducting an SLR. It is hoped that other researchers would be able to replicate this approach in doing SLR for other research domains such as software engineering and information technology fields of study.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews require expert reviewers to manually screen thousands of citations in order to identify all relevant articles to the review. Active learning text classification is a supervised machine learning approach that has been shown to significantly reduce the manual annotation workload by semi-automating the citation screening process of systematic reviews. In this paper, we present a new topic detection method that induces an informative representation of studies, to improve the performance of the underlying active learner. Our proposed topic detection method uses a neural network-based vector space model to capture semantic similarities between documents. We firstly represent documents within the vector space, and cluster the documents into a predefined number of clusters. The centroids of the clusters are treated as latent topics. We then represent each document as a mixture of latent topics. For evaluation purposes, we employ the active learning strategy using both our novel topic detection method and a baseline topic model (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Results obtained demonstrate that our method is able to achieve a high sensitivity of eligible studies and a significantly reduced manual annotation cost when compared to the baseline method. This observation is consistent across two clinical and three public health reviews. The tool introduced in this work is available from https://nactem.ac.uk/pvtopic/.},

abstract = {Objective The combination of phenomic data from electronic health records (EHR) and clinical data repositories with dense biological data has enabled genomic and pharmacogenomic discovery, a first step toward precision medicine. Computational methods for the identification of clinical phenotypes from EHR data will advance our understanding of disease risk and drug response, and support the practice of precision medicine on a national scale. Methods Based on our experience within three national research networks, we summarize the broad approaches to clinical phenotyping and highlight the important role of these networks in the progression of high-throughput phenotyping and precision medicine. We provide supporting literature in the form of a non-systematic review. Results The practice of clinical phenotyping is evolving to meet the growing demand for scalable, portable, and data driven methods and tools. The resources required for traditional phenotyping algorithms from expert defined rules are significant. In contrast, machine learning approaches that rely on data patterns will require fewer clinical domain experts and resources. Conclusions Machine learning approaches that generate phenotype definitions from patient features and clinical profiles will result in truly computational phenotypes, derived from data rather than experts. Research networks and phenotype developers should cooperate to develop methods, collaboration platforms, and data standards that will enable computational phenotyping and truly modernize biomedical research and precision medicine.},

abstract = {Research into cyberbullying detection has increased in recent years, due in part to the proliferation of cyberbullying across social media and its detrimental effect on young people. A growing body of work is emerging on automated approaches to cyberbullying detection. These approaches utilise machine learning and natural language processing techniques to identify the characteristics of a cyberbullying exchange and automatically detect cyberbullying by matching textual data to the identified traits. In this paper, we present a systematic review of published research (as identified via Scopus, ACM and IEEE Xplore bibliographic databases) on cyberbullying detection approaches. On the basis of our extensive literature review, we categorise existing approaches into 4 main classes, namely; supervised learning, lexicon based, rule based and mixed-initiative approaches. Supervised learning-based approaches typically use classifiers such as SVM and Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes to develop predictive models for cyberbullying detection. Lexicon based systems utilise word lists and use the presence of words within the lists to detect cyberbullying. Rules-based approaches match text to predefined rules to identify bullying and mixed-initiatives approaches combine human-based reasoning with one or more of the aforementioned approaches. We found lack of quality representative labelled datasets and non-holistic consideration of cyberbullying by researchers when developing detection systems are two key challenges facing cyberbullying detection research. This paper essentially maps out the state-of-the-art in cyberbullying detection research and serves as a resource for researchers to determine where to best direct their future research efforts in this field.},

abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

abstract = {Tools for automatic subject assignment help deal with scale and sustainability in creating and enriching metadata, establishing more connections across and between resources and enhancing consistency. Although some software vendors and experimental researchers claim the tools can replace manual subject indexing, hard scientific evidence of their performance in operating information environments is scarce. A major reason for this is that research is usually conducted in laboratory conditions, excluding the complexities of real-life systems and situations. The article reviews and discusses issues with existing evaluation approaches such as problems of aboutness and relevance assessments, implying the need to use more than a single ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù method when evaluating indexing and retrieval, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework. The framework is informed by a systematic review of the literature on evaluation approaches: evaluating indexing quality directly through assessment by an evaluator or through comparison with a gold standard, evaluating the quality of computer-assisted indexing directly in the context of an indexing workflow, and evaluating indexing quality indirectly through analyzing retrieval performance.},

Objective: To utilize citation analysis and automated topic analysis to characterize the SE research literature over the years focusing on those papers published in ESEM. Method: We collected data from Scopus database consisting of 513 ESEM papers. For thematic analysis, we used topic modeling to automatically generate the most probable topic distributions given the data. Results: Nearly 42{\%} of the papers have not been cited at all but the effect seems to wear off as time passes. Using text mining of article titles and abstracts, we found that currently the most popular research topics in the ESEM community are: systematic reviews, testing, defects, cost estimation, and team work. Conclusions: While this study analyzes the paper pool of the ESEM symposium, the approach can easily be applied to any other sub-set of SE papers to conduct large scale studies. Due to large volumes of research in SE, we suggest using the automated analysis of bibliometrics as we have done in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {While systematic reviews are positioned as an essential element of modern evidence-based medical practice, the creation of these reviews is resource intensive. To mitigate this problem, there have been some attempts to leverage supervised machine learning to automate the article triage procedure. This approach has been proved to be helpful for updating existing systematic reviews. However, this technique holds very little promise for creating new reviews because training data is rarely available when it comes to systematic creation. In this research we assess and compare the applicability of semi-supervised learning to overcome this labeling bottleneck and support the creation of systematic reviews. The results indicated that semi-supervised learning could significantly reduce the human effort and is a viable technique for automating medical systematic review creation with a small-sized training dataset. {\textcopyright} 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract = {Systematic reviews are instances of a critically important search task in medicine and health services research. Along with large and well conducted randomised control trials, they provide the highest levels of clinical evidence. We provide a brief overview of the methodologies used to conduct systematic reviews, and report on our recent experience of conducting a meta-review i.e. a systematic review of reviews of preoperative assessment. We discuss issues associated with the large manual effort currently necessary to conduct systematic reviews when using available search engines. We then suggest ways in which more dedicated and sophisticated information retrieval tools may enhance the efficiency of systematic searches and increase the recall of results. Finally, we discuss the development of tests collections for systematic reviews, to permit the development of enhanced search engines for this t},

abstract = {This paper presents a formalism for considering the issues of learning in design. A foundation for machine learning in design (MLinD) is defined so as to provide answers to basic questions on learning in design, such as, "What types of knowledge can be learnt?", "How does learning occur?", and "When does learning occur?". Five main elements of MLinD are presented as the input knowledge, knowledge transformers, output knowledge, goals/reasons for learning, and learning triggers. Using this foundation, published systems in MLinD were reviewed. The systematic review presents a basis for validating the presented foundation. The paper concludes that there is considerable work to be carried out in order to fully formalize the foundation of MLinD.},

abstract = {Searching and retrieving information, especially in the context of a professional search environment, can be an arduous task. Professional search is defined as ‚Äúinteractive information retrieval performed by professionals in a specific domain‚Äù [1]. These searchers have competencies and skills in searching and as such demand high quality information retrieved and are willing to spend time to find the required information. This chapter aims to analyse research into users' search behaviors in professional search enviroments. The method of systematic review was adopted and two types of studies were identified ‚Äúsystem-centered‚Äù and ‚Äúuser-centered‚Äù studies. An emphasis was placed on the methods each type of study adopted to meet its purposes. It was found that systemcentered studies employed mainly quantitative methods (Log analysis) to evaluate system's performance and retrieval techniques whereas usercentered studies adopted mainly qualitative methods to provide an insight into users' behaviors. In addition, system-centered studies examined users' behavior as a series of clicks, search terms employed and features used to develop systems that satisfy user's information needs. In contrast, user-centered studies explored users' behavior with the view to identify the specific search processes, thoughts and decisions made while searching as well as the factors affecting their search behaviors. This chapter contributes to providing an understanding of both the methods and approaches adopted to study users' behavior in a professional search environment. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {The Sign Language Recognition (SLR) Problem is a highly important research topic, because of its ability to increase the interaction between the people who are hearing-impaired or impediment in speech. We propose a simple but robust system. The proposed system consists of three main steps. First we apply segmentation to the face and hand region by using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) and Thresholding. FCM is a clustering technique which employs fuzzy partitioning, in an iterative algorithm. After the face and hands are segmented, the feature vectors are extracted. The feature vectors are chosen among the low level features such as the bounding ellipse, bounding box, and center of mass coordinates, since they are known to be more robust to segmentation errors due to low resolution images. In total there are 23 features for each hand. After the feature vectors are extracted, they are used for recognition with discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Recognition stage is composed of two stages, namely training and classification. The Baum Welch algorithm is used for HMM training. In classification part the likelihood of each HMM is calculated and the HMM with the highest likelihood is chosen. In order to measure the success rate of the system, the eNTERFACE dataset is used. In this dataset 8 different American Sign Language example classified and in user independent case, is shown to be working with 94.19{\%} accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Each example in a multi-label dataset is associated with multiple labels, which are often correlated. Learning from this data can be improved when dimensionality reduction tasks, such as feature selection, are applied. The standard approach for multi-label feature selection transforms the multi-label dataset into single-label datasets before using traditional feature selection algorithms. However, this approach often ignores label dependence. In this work, we propose an alternative method, LCFS, that constructs new labels based on relations between the original labels. By doing so, the label set from the data is augmented with second-order information before applying the standard approach. To assess LCFS, an experimental evaluation using Information Gain as a measure to estimate the importance of features was carried out on 10 benchmark multi-label datasets. This evaluation compared four LCFS settings with the standard approach, using random feature selection as a reference. For each dataset, the performance of a feature selection method is estimated by the quality of the classifiers built from the data described by the features selected by the method. The results show that a simple LCFS setting gave rise to classifiers similar to, or better than, the ones built using the standard approach. Furthermore, this work also pioneers the use of the systematic review method to survey the related work on multi-label feature selection. The summary of the 99 papers found promotes the idea that exploring label dependence during feature selection can lead to good results.},

abstract = {Search filters are increasingly used to search medical databases to identify specific topics or study designs. In particular, search filters have been designed to help health-care professionals identify systematic reviews of the effectiveness of health interventions. Identifying systematic reviews in databases such as MEDLINE is problematic and research has previously been undertaken into methods to design search filters that retrieve systematic reviews effectively. The aim of this study was to improve previously developed methods to derive a more objective search strategy to identify systematic reviews in MEDLINE. A ‚Äòquasi-gold standard' collection of known systematic reviews was identified. A frequency analysis of words within a subset of the ‚Äòquasi-gold standard' was undertaken followed by a statistical analysis of the most frequently occurring words. This analysis determined which terms would best distinguish between systematic reviews, non-systematic reviews and non-reviews. The performance of the best models was tested on the remaining subset of ‚Äòquasi-gold standard' records and then using the OVID interface to MEDLINE. The best model had a sensitivity of 73.4{\%} for systematic reviews in the test set and 84.2{\%} when used with the validation set. The best model had a specificity of 98.3{\%} in the test set and 93{\%} in the validation set. When tested on the same ‚Äòquasi-gold standard' using OVID MED-LINE the model showed 100{\%} sensitivity and 4.4{\%} precision. The number of times a term occurs in a record adds discriminatory power to the search strategy. Apparently highly relevant terms chosen subjectively do not perform as well as those derived by a statistical approach. Some search terms may not immediately seem useful in identifying systematic reviews, but when used in combination with other terms they prove to be highly discriminating. The best performing filters were tested on the OVID interface, but without frequency and term weightings. Their performance was also compared to previously published filters. One of the strategies was found to perform better with respect to sensitivity than previously published filters, although with lower precision.},

abstract = {Currently, most people use NCBI's PubMed to search the MEDLINE database, an important bibliographical information source for life science and biomedical information. However, PubMed has some drawbacks that make it difficult to find relevant publications pertaining to users' individual intentions, especially for non-expert users. To ameliorate the disadvantages of PubMed, we developed G-Bean, a graph based biomedical search engine, to search biomedical articles in MEDLINE database more efficiently. G-Bean addresses PubMed's limitations with three innovations: (1) Parallel document index creation: a multithreaded index creation strategy is employed to generate the document index for G-Bean in parallel; (2) Ontology-graph based query expansion: an ontology graph is constructed by merging four major UMLS (Version 2013AA) vocabularies, MeSH, SNOMEDCT, CSP and AOD, to cover all concepts in National Library of Medicine (NLM) database; a Personalized PageRank algorithm is used to compute concept relevance in this ontology graph and the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme is used to re-rank the concepts. The top 500 ranked concepts are selected for expanding the initial query to retrieve more accurate and relevant information; (3) Retrieval and re-ranking of documents based on user's search intention: after the user selects any article from the existing search results, G-Bean analyzes user's selections to determine his/her true search intention and then uses more relevant and more specific terms to retrieve additional related articles. The new articles are presented to the user in the order of their relevance to the already selected articles. Performance evaluation with 106 OHSUMED benchmark queries shows that G-Bean returns more relevant results than PubMed does when using these queries to search the MEDLINE database. PubMed could not even return any search result for some OHSUMED queries because it failed to form the appropriate Boolean query statement automatically from the natural language query strings. G-Bean is available at http://bioinformatics.clemson.edu/G-Bean/index.php. G-Bean addresses PubMed's limitations with ontology-graph based query expansion, automatic document indexing, and user search intention discovery. It shows significant advantages in finding relevant articles from the MEDLINE database to meet the information need of the user.},

abstract = {Database search strategies for systematic reviews are often developed subjectively and may miss relevant studies. We examined whether objective methods, originally developed to identify systematic reviews, could be applied to a multidisciplinary topic, alcohol-impaired driving (AID). We performed word-frequency analyses of titles/abstracts/keywords on citations randomly selected from a 'gold standard' database of 131 controlled studies evaluating AID interventions. Identified words were tested in the Web of Science databases for sensitivity, precision, and feasibility. Words meeting varying sensitivity and precision thresholds were combined into search strategies. All threshold combinations with cumulative sensitivity of at least 75{\%} retrieved ‚â• 100,000 citations. The word frequency-based procedure was therefore modified, first by eliminating non-specific words, then by categorizing and combining the remaining words. With these modifications, sensitivity was 80.0{\%} and precision 4.4{\%}, retrieving 17,565 citations. Against a validation set, sensitivity was 85.7{\%} and precision 3.5{\%}. To identify studies on multidisciplinary topics, objective methods may be useful initially but may need to be modified to meet sensitivity and feasibility targets. {\textcopyright} CILIP.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a hybrid algorithm combining support vector regression with evolutionary strategy (SVR-ES) in order to build successful predictive models for downscaling problems. SVR-ES uses uncorrelated mutation with p step sizes to find the optimal SVR hyper-parameters. Two downscaling forecast problems used in the WCCI-2006 contest - surface air temperature and precipitation - were tested. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) as benchmark and a variety of machine learning techniques including bootstrap-aggregated ensemble artificial neural network (ANN), SVR with hyper-parameters given by the Cherkassky-Ma estimate and random forest (RF). We also tested all techniques with using stepwise linear regression (SLR) first to screen out irrelevant predictors. We concluded that SVR-ES is an attractive approach because it tends to outperform the other techniques and can also be implemented in an almost automatic way. The Cherkassky-Ma estimate is a useful approach to minimizing the MAE error and also saves computational time related to the hyper-parameter search. The ANN and RF are also good options to outperform multiple linear regression (MLR). Finally, the use of SLR for predictor selection can dramatically reduce computational time and often help to enhance accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Improvement and evaluation of software quality is a recurring and crucial activity in the software development life-cycle. During software development, software artifacts such as requirement documents, comments in source code, design documents, and change requests are created containing natural language text. For analyzing natural text, specialized text analysis techniques are available. However, a consolidated body of knowledge about research using text analysis techniques to improve and evaluate software quality still needs to be established. To contribute to the establishment of such a body of knowledge, we aimed at extracting relevant information from the scientific literature about data sources, research contributions, and the usage of text analysis techniques for the improvement and evaluation of software quality. We conducted a mapping study by performing the following steps: define research questions, prepare search string and find relevant literature, apply screening process, classify, and extract data. Bug classification and bug severity assignment activities within defect management are frequently improved using the text analysis techniques of classification and concept extraction. Non-functional requirements elicitation activity of requirements engineering is mostly improved using the technique of concept extraction. The quality characteristic which is frequently evaluated for the product quality model is operability. The most commonly used data sources are: bug report, requirement documents, and software reviews. The dominant type of research contributions are solution proposals and validation research. In our mapping study we identified 81 relevant primary studies. We pointed out research directions to improve and evaluate software quality and future research directions for using natural language text analysis techniques in the context of software quality improvement.},

abstract = {The heuristic search processes like simple genetic algorithms help in achieving optimization but do not guarantee robustness so there is an immediate need of a machine learning technique that also promises robustness. Diploid genetic algorithms ensure consistent results and can therefore replace Simple genetic algorithms in applications such as test data generation and regression testing, where robustness is more important. However, there is a need to review the work that has been done so far in the field. It is also important to analyse the applicability of the premise of the dominance techniques applied so far in order to implement the technique. The work presents a systematic review of diploid genetic algorithms, examines the premise of the dominance relation used in different works and discusses the future scope. The work also discusses the biological basis of evaluating dominance. The work is important as the future of machine learning relies on techniques that are robust as well as efficient.},

abstract = {The Q-UEL language of XML-like tags and the associated software applications are providing a valuable toolkit for Evidence Based Medicine (EBM). In this paper the already existing applications, data bases, and tags are brought together with new ones. The particular Q-UEL embodiment used here is the BioIngine. The main challenge is one of bringing together the methods of symbolic reasoning and calculative probabilistic inference that underlie EBM and medical decision making. Some space is taken to review this background. The unification is greatly facilitated by Q-UEL's roots in the notation and algebra of Dirac, and by extending Q-UEL into the Wolfram programming environment. Further, the overall problem of integration is also a relatively simple one because of the nature of Q-UEL as a language for interoperability in healthcare and biomedicine, while the notion of workflow is facilitated because of the EBM best practice known as PICO. What remains difficult is achieving a high degree of overall automation because of a well-known difficulty in capturing human expertise in computers: the Feigenbaum bottleneck.},

In this paper we present a real-world case study supporting a broad topic systematic review in the public health domain. We provide experimental results that demonstrate how retrieval performance on bibliographic citations can be materially improved. We attained an average precision of 0.57 and recall approaching 80{\%} at a very reasonable screening depth. These results represent 18{\%} and 23{\%} relative gains over a baseline classifier. We also address pragmatic issues that arise when working on "noisy" real-world data, such as coping with citation records that often have empty fields.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Missing Values (MV) present a serious problem facing research in software engineering (SE) which is mainly based on statistical and/or data mining analysis of SE data. The simple method of dealing with MV is to ignore data with missing observations. This leads to losing valuable information and then obtaining biased results. Therefore, various techniques have been developed to deal adequately with MV, especially those based on imputation methods. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was carried out to summarize the existing techniques dealing with MV in SE datasets and to classify the selected studies according to six classification criteria: research type, research approach, MV technique, MV type, data types and MV objective. Publication channels and trends were also identified. As results, 35 papers concerning MV treatments of SE data were selected. This study shows an increasing interest in machine learning (ML) techniques especially the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) to deal with MV in SE datasets and found that most of the MV techniques are used to serve software development effort estimation techniques.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an increasingly important tool for the study of the human genome. SNPs can be used as markers to create high-density genetic maps, as causal candidates for diseases, or to reconstruct the history of our genome. SNP-based studies rely on the availability of large numbers of validated, high-frequency SNPs whose position on the chromosomes is known with precision. Although large collections of SNPs exist in public databases, researchers need tools to effectively retrieve and manipulate them. RESULTS: We describe the implementation and usage of SNPper, a web-based application to automate the tasks of extracting SNPs from public databases, analyzing them and exporting them in formats suitable for subsequent use. Our application is oriented toward the needs of candidate-gene, whole-genome and fine-mapping studies, and provides several flexible ways to present and export the data. The application has been publicly available for over a year, and has received positive user feedback and high usage levels.},

@article{Teixeira201710,
abstract = {Objective Infobuttons are clinical decision tools embedded in the electronic health record that attempt to link clinical data with context sensitive knowledge resources. We systematically reviewed technical approaches that contribute to improved infobutton design, implementation and functionality. Methods We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database from inception to March 1, 2016 for studies describing the use of infobuttons. We selected full review comparative studies, usability studies, and qualitative studies examining infobutton design and implementation. We abstracted usability measures such as user satisfaction, impact, and efficiency, as well as prediction accuracy of infobutton content retrieval algorithms and infobutton adoption/interoperability. Results We found 82 original research studies on infobuttons. Twelve studies met criteria for detailed abstraction. These studies investigated infobutton interoperability (1 study); tools to help tailor infobutton functionality (1 study); interventions to improve user experience (7 studies); and interventions to improve content retrieval by improving prediction of relevant knowledge resources and information needs (3 studies). In-depth interviews with implementers showed the Health Level Seven (HL7) Infobutton standard to be simple and easy to implement. A usability study demonstrated the feasibility of a tool to help medical librarians tailor infobutton functionality. User experience studies showed that access to resources with which users are familiar increased user satisfaction ratings; and that links to specific subsections of drug monographs increased information seeking efficiency. However, none of the user experience improvements led to increased usage uptake. Recommender systems based on machine learning algorithms outperformed hand-crafted rules in the prediction of relevant resources and clinicians' information needs in a laboratory setting, but no studies were found using these techniques in clinical settings. Improved content indexing in one study led to improved content retrieval across three health care organizations. Conclusion Best practice technical approaches to ensure optimal infobutton functionality, design and implementation remain understudied. The HL7 Infobutton standard has supported wide adoption of infobutton functionality among clinical information systems and knowledge resources. Limited evidence supports infobutton enhancements such as links to specific subtopics, configuration of optimal resources for specific tasks and users, and improved indexing and content coverage. Further research is needed to investigate user experience improvements to increase infobutton use and effectiveness.},

abstract = {The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54{\%}). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30{\%}), rehabilitation (7, 35{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20{\%}), falls (2, 10{\%}) and mental health (1, 5{\%}). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and ‚Äòsilo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.},

abstract = {Background and objective Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), which can significantly decrease the quality of life is associated with a major risk factor of health implications such as increased cardiovascular disease, sudden death, depression, irritability, hypertension, and learning difficulties. Thus, it is relevant and timely to present a systematic review describing significant applications in the framework of computational intelligence-based SAS, including its performance, beneficial and challenging effects, and modeling for the decision-making on multiple scenarios. Methods This study aims to systematically review the literature on systems for the detection and/or prediction of apnea events using a classification model. Results Forty-five included studies revealed a combination of classification techniques for the diagnosis of apnea, such as threshold-based (14.75{\%}) and machine learning (ML) models (85.25{\%}). In addition, the ML models, were clustered in a mind map, include neural networks (44.26{\%}), regression (4.91{\%}), instance-based (11.47{\%}), Bayesian algorithms (1.63{\%}), reinforcement learning (4.91{\%}), dimensionality reduction (8.19{\%}), ensemble learning (6.55{\%}), and decision trees (3.27{\%}). Conclusions A classification model should provide an auto-adaptive and no external-human action dependency. In addition, the accuracy of the classification models is related with the effective features selection. New high-quality studies based on randomized controlled trials and validation of models using a large and multiple sample of data are recommended.},

abstract = {We describe a prototype for a hybrid system designed to reduce the number of citations needed to re-screen (NNRS) by systematic reviewers, where citations include titles, abstracts, and metadata. The system obviates the need for screening the entire set of citations a second time, which is typically done to control human error. The reference set is based on a complex review about organ transplantation (N=10,796 citations). Data were split into 50{\%} training and test sets, randomly stratified for percentage eligible citations. The system consists of a rule-based module and a machine-learning (ML) module. The former substantially reduces the number of negative citations passed to the ML module and improves imbalance. Relative to the baseline, the system reduces classification error (5.6{\%} vs 2.9{\%}) thereby reducing NNRS by 47.3{\%} (300 vs 158). We discuss the implications of de-emphasizing sensitivity (recall) in favor of specificity and negative predictive value to reduce screening burden.},

abstract = {In industrial organisations, software products are quite large and complex, consisting of a number of classes. Thus, it is not possible to test all the products with a finite number of resources. Hence, it would be beneficial if we could predict in advance some of the attributes associated with the classes such as change proneness, defect proneness, maintenance effort, etc. In this paper, we have dealt with one of the quality attributes, i.e., change proneness. Changes in the software are unavoidable and thus, early prediction of change proneness will help the developers to focus the limited resources on the classes which are predicted to be change-prone. We have conducted a systematic review which evaluates all the available important studies relevant to the area of change proneness. This will help us to identify gaps in the current technology and discuss possible new directions of research in the areas related to change proneness.},

Creating a decision support architecture to assist participants of a systematic review in the selection process of the individual studies and quality assessment of these studies, possibly improving the execution time and reducing the evaluation bias. Method. Improving the primary studies selection and quality assessment processes by using text mining techniques and ontologies to construct a decision support architecture. We will also conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed architecture. Contribution.

abstract = {Today, the use of social networks is growing ceaselessly and rapidly. More alarming is the fact that these networks have become a substantial pool for unstructured data that belong to a host of domains, including business, governments and health. The increasing reliance on social networks calls for data mining techniques that is likely to facilitate reforming the unstructured data and place them within a systematic pattern. The goal of the present survey is to analyze the data mining techniques that were utilized by social media networks between 2003 and 2015. Espousing criterion-based research strategies, 66 articles were identified to constitute the source of the present paper. After a careful review of these articles, we found that 19 data mining techniques have been used with social media data to address 9 different research objectives in 6 different industrial and services domains. However, the data mining applications in the social media are still raw and require more effort by academia and industry to adequately perform the job. We suggest that more research be conducted by both the academia and the industry since the studies done so far are not sufficiently exhaustive of data mining techniques.},

abstract = {The terms ‚ÄúOracle Problem‚Äù and ‚ÄúNon-testable system‚Äù interchangeably refer to programs in which the application of test oracles is infeasible. Test oracles are an integral part of conventional testing techniques; thus, such techniques are inoperable in these programs. The prevalence of the oracle problem has inspired the research community to develop several automated testing techniques that can detect functional software faults in such programs. These techniques include N-Version testing, Metamorphic Testing, Assertions, Machine Learning Oracles, and Statistical Hypothesis Testing. This paper presents a Mapping Study that covers these techniques. The Mapping Study presents a series of discussions about each technique, from different perspectives, e.g. effectiveness, efficiency, and usability. It also presents a comparative analysis of these techniques in terms of these perspectives. Finally, potential research opportunities within the non-testable systems problem domain are highlighted within the Mapping Study. We believe that the aforementioned discussions and comparative analysis will be invaluable for new researchers that are attempting to familiarise themselves with the field, and be a useful resource for practitioners that are in the process of selecting an appropriate technique for their context, or deciding how to apply their selected technique. We also believe that our own insights, which are embedded throughout these discussions and the comparative analysis, will be useful for researchers that are already accustomed to the field. It is our hope that the potential research opportunities that have been highlighted by the Mapping Study will steer the direction of future research endeavours. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract = {Across neuroscience research, clinical diagnostics, and engineering applications in pain evaluation and treatment, there is a need for an objective measure of pain experience and detection when it occurs. This detector should be reliable in real-world settings using easily accessible, non-invasive data sources. We present a simple yet robust paradigm for decoding pain using neural and physiological data including electroencephalography (EEG), pulse, and skin conductance (GSR) measurements. The present study uses multivariate classification to distinguish painful events from non-painful multimodal sensory stimuli. To classify the pain response and detect relevant data attributes, we employed a sparse logistic regression (SLR) machine learning protocol with automatic feature selection. EEG input consisted of time-frequency changes under trial conditions, and physiological data included fluctuations and spikes in pulse and skin conductance. Classification averaged 70{\%} accuracy and selected between 5 and 15 features. In our experiment, pain was induced by cold stimulation which became noxious with prolonged exposure. Due to the long, ramp-and-hold nature of the stimulus, along with individual variability in sensitivity to pain, we did not observe specific rapid evoked responses or time-locked events common across participants. However, this format more closely resembles the experience of pain conditions requiring intervention which could be facilitated by a decoding system. The results illustrate the feasibility of developing a wireless pain detection system and give insight to important temporal, spectral, and spatial EEG events and physiological indicators of pain states. Success of the classifier protocol using these parameters could lead to the creation of a closed-loop system for decoding and intervention which can be applied in engineering and medical contexts.},

abstract = {At the present time there is a considerable amount of development interest in the use of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data for 3D reconstruction and modelling in the fields of heritage recording and plant documentation. TLS technology produces point clouds of very high density in a very short time. When surveying an object of complex geometry, multiple scans are typically required to generate an occlusion-free 3D model. The principal task associated with building 3D models from laser scanner data in such cases is to transform the scan data from the sensor's local coordinate system into a uniform Cartesian reference datum. This is necessary in order to join the multiple point clouds. This paper presents a registration procedure for TLS data whereby the exterior orientations of the TLS stations are determined via photogrammetry. The images from a digital camera mounted on top of the laser scanner are used first to relatively orient the network of images and then transfer this orientation to the TLS stations to provide exterior orientation and thus a one-step registration of the point clouds from each scanner position. Test results obtained with the proposed approach are presented to highlight its efficiency and accuracy.},

@inproceedings{Tsujii20139,
abstract = {In the last two decades, we have witnessed the rapid development of techniques in statistical modeling of language, which exploit large collections of text to reveal statistical regularities in language uses. However, the statistics-based approach to language,which tends to ignore or deemphasize structural issues of language, has shown its own limitations. The approach in its strictest form, for example, fails to treat the systematic mapping between syntax and semantics of language (i.e. the compositional aspect of meaning).An increasing number of researchers have become interested in combining linguistic theories, which treat the compositional aspect of meaning, with statistical modeling of language. On the other hand, the community of knowledge-mining and semantic search has constructed large knowledge bases such as Freebase, Yago and Wikipedia. Although these knowledge-bases have been constructed independently of the interests in the NLP research community, they provide essential resources for research on Natural Language Understanding, which aims to develop a system which understands language as human being does. The first step of such an understanding system is to relate surface forms of language with corresponding units in knowledge-bases. Once text is mapped to representation in the knowledge domain, one can perform inferences of various sorts by combining it with knowledge in the knowledge base. Inferences, which combine information embedded within text with human knowledge which is external to text, are deemed essential in text understanding. The two streams of research in the above seem to be tackling the same problem of how surface expressions in text can be linked with extra-linguistic representation in the knowledge domain, and what roles the structure of language plays in such a linking process. With this broad perspective in mind, I will address the following research topics which I have been involved in: (1) Parsing and Semantics: While the performance of a syntactic parser has been improved substantially of late, it still fails to treat semantically crucial constructions. In order to resolve the difficulties which remain in parsing, we have to treat semantics of language more systematically than the current state of the arts parsers do. I would argue that we cannot resolve the difficulties without referring to proper theories of syntax. (2) Entity linking: Disambiguation in entity-linking has been carried out by using characteristics specific to individual entities. However, in order to treat long-tail problems in entity-linking, not only properties of individual entities but also classes of entities and their properties in knowledge bases have to be exploited. The results of our recent experiments will be presented, in order to illustrate how structures in knowledge bases can be used for interpretation of expressions in language. (3) Relation linking: The same relation in the knowledge domain can be expressed by diverse surface expressions in language. To gather surface relation expressions for a given set of relations in the knowledge domain is a crucial step of linking text with knowledge. Some of our recent studies in relation extraction will be presented as the next step of linking text with knowledge bases. (4) Paraphrasing and structures of sentences: While semantics of words have been studied extensively both in distributional semantics and traditional linguistics (e.g. synonyms, antonyms, etc.), semantics of larger units such as phrases and clauses have not been studied with similar degrees of details. Paraphrase recognition by structure alignment will provide a framework to capture semantics of larger units in language than words. We discuss how structures of sentences together with inferences based on meaning can give fine grained explanation of paraphrases, and how such research will contribute to the task of linking text with knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2013 National Chengchi University.

@inproceedings{ArguelloCasteleiro2016,
abstract = {Background: Automatic identification of gene and protein names from biomedical publications can help curators and researchers to keep up with the findings published in the scientific literature. As of today, this is a challenging task related to information retrieval, and in the realm of Big Data Analytics. Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of using word embeddings (i.e. distributed word representations) from Deep Learning algorithms together with terms from the Cardiovascular Disease Ontology (CVDO) as a step to identifying omics information encoded in the biomedical literature. Methods: Word embeddings were generated using the neural language models CBOW and Skip-gram with an input of more than 14 million PubMed citations (titles and abstracts) corresponding to articles published between 2000 and 2016. Then the abstracts of selected papers from the sysVASC systematic review were manually annotated with gene/protein names. We set up two experiments that used the word embeddings to produce term variants for gene/protein names: the first experiment used the terms manually annotated from the papers; the second experiment enriched/expanded the annotated terms using terms from the human-readable labels of key classes (gene/proteins) from the CVDO ontology. CVDO is formalised in the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) and contains 172,121 UniProt Knowledgebase protein classes related to human and 86,792 UniProtKB protein classes related to mouse. The hypothesis is that by enriching the original annotated terms, a better context is provided, and therefore, it is easier to obtain suitable (full and/or partial) term variants for gene/protein names from word embeddings. Results: From the papers manually annotated, a list of 107 terms (gene/protein names) was acquired. As part of the word embeddings generated from CBOW and Skip-gram, a lexicon with more than 9 million terms was created. Using the cosine similarity metric, a list of the 12 top-ranked terms was generated from word embeddings for query terms present in the generated lexicon. Domain experts evaluated a total of 1968 pairs of terms and classified the retrieved terms as: TV (term variant); PTV (partial term variant); and NTV (non term variant, meaning none of the previous two categories). In experiment I, Skip-gram finds the double amount of (full and/or partial) term variants for gene/protein names as compared with CBOW. Using Skip-gram, the weighted Cohen's Kappa inter-annotator agreement for two domain experts was 0.80 for the first experiment and 0.74 for the second experiment. In the first experiment, suitable (full and/or partial) term variants were found for 65 of the 107 terms. In the second experiment, the number increased to 100. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the benefits of using terms from the CVDO ontology classes to obtain more pertinent term variants for gene/protein names from word embeddings generated from an unannotated corpus with more than 14 million PubMed citations. As the terms variants are induced from the biomedical literature, they can facilitate data tagging and semantic indexing tasks. Overall, our study explores the feasibility of obtaining methods that scale when dealing with big data, and which enable automation of deep semantic analysis and markup of textual information from unannotated biomedical literature.},

Despite its relevance, most of the process is conducted manually, implying additional effort when the Selection Review task is performed and leading to reading all studies under analysis more than once. Objective: We propose an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques to assist the Selection Review task in SLR. It is implemented into a VTM tool (Revis), which is freely available for use. Method: We have selected and implemented appropriate visualization techniques into our approach and validated and demonstrated its usefulness in performing real SLRs. Results: The results have shown that employment of VTM techniques can successfully assist in the Selection Review task, speeding up the entire SLR process in comparison to the conventional approach. Conclusion: VTM techniques are valuable tools to be used in the context of selecting studies in the SLR process, prone to speed up some stages of SLRs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Objectives Extracting data from publication reports is a standard process in systematic review (SR) development. However, the data extraction process still relies too much on manual effort which is slow, costly, and subject to human error. In this study, we developed a text summarization system aimed at enhancing productivity and reducing errors in the traditional data extraction process. Methods We developed a computer system that used machine learning and natural language processing approaches to automatically generate summaries of full-text scientific publications. The summaries at the sentence and fragment levels were evaluated in finding common clinical SR data elements such as sample size, group size, and PICO values. We compared the computer-generated summaries with human written summaries (title and abstract) in terms of the presence of necessary information for the data extraction as presented in the Cochrane review's study characteristics tables. Results At the sentence level, the computer-generated summaries covered more information than humans do for systematic reviews (recall 91.2{\%} vs. 83.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). They also had a better density of relevant sentences (precision 59{\%} vs. 39{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). At the fragment level, the ensemble approach combining rule-based, concept mapping, and dictionary-based methods performed better than individual methods alone, achieving an 84.7{\%} F-measure. Conclusion Computer-generated summaries are potential alternative information sources for data extraction in systematic review development. Machine learning and natural language processing are promising approaches to the development of such an extractive summarization system.},

Therefore, it is commonly utilized in the field of sentimental analysis to achieve the particular business goals. Different ensemble approaches are frequently introduced to unify the desired classifiers for the improvement of sentimental classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study is available yet that investigate and summarize the leading ensemble approaches, classifiers, features, tools and datasets altogether in the domain of sentimental analysis. Therefore, in this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to identify 31 studies published during 2008--2016. Subsequently, 14 modern ensemble techniques, 26 leading classifiers, 15 benchmark datasets, 19 prominent features and 8 tools are presented in the context of sentimental analysis.

METHOD: According to preset protocols, the Pubmed, Socups and Web of Science databases were searched to find studies that matched the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and then its references were checked for new studies. A quality checklist assessed the selected studies, and removed the low quality ones. The remaining ones (included set) had their data extracted and summarized. RESULTS: The summary of the data of the 37 included studies showed that the most common goal of the selected studies was the prediction of the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's Disease, for studies that used machine learning, and cost estimation for the microsimulation ones. About the variables, neuroimaging was the most frequent used. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic literature review showed clear trends in prognosis of dementia research in what concerns machine learning techniques and microsimulation.},

abstract = {Objective Systematic Reviews (SRs) are utilized to summarize evidence from high quality studies and are considered the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting SRs can be time and labor intensive due to the high cost of article screening. In previous studies, we demonstrated utilizing established (lexical) article relationships to facilitate the identification of relevant articles in an efficient and effective manner. Here we propose to enhance article relationships with background semantic knowledge derived from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts and ontologies. Methods We developed a pipelined semantic concepts representation process to represent articles from an SR into an optimized and enriched semantic space of UMLS concepts. Throughout the process, we leveraged concepts and concept relations encoded in biomedical ontologies (SNOMED-CT and MeSH) within the UMLS framework to prompt concept features of each article. Article relationships (similarities) were established and represented as a semantic article network, which was readily applied to assist with the article screening process. We incorporated the concept of active learning to simulate an interactive article recommendation process, and evaluated the performance on 15 completed SRs. We used work saved over sampling at 95{\%} recall (WSS95) as the performance measure. Results We compared the WSS95 performance of our ontology-based semantic approach to existing lexical feature approaches and corpus-based semantic approaches, and found that we had better WSS95 in most SRs. We also had the highest average WSS95 of 43.81{\%} and the highest total WSS95 of 657.18{\%}. Conclusion We demonstrated using ontology-based semantics to facilitate the identification of relevant articles for SRs. Effective concepts and concept relations derived from UMLS ontologies can be utilized to establish article semantic relationships. Our approach provided a promising performance and can easily apply to any SR topics in the biomedical domain with generalizability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a supervised learning approach to support the screening of HIV literature. The manual screening of biomedical literature is an important task in the process of systematic reviews. Researchers and curators have the very demanding, time-consuming and error-prone task of manually identifying documents that must be included in a systematic review concerning a specific problem. We implemented a supervised learning approach to support screening tasks, by automatically flagging potentially selected documents in a list retrieved by a literature database search. To overcome the main issues associated with the automatic literature screening task, we evaluated the use of data sampling, feature combinations, and feature selection methods, generating a total of 105 classification models. The models yielding best results were composed by the Logistic Model Trees classifier, a fairly balanced training set, and feature combination of Bag-Of-Words and MeSH terms. According to our results, the system correctly labels the great majority of relevant documents, and it could be used to support HIV systematic reviews to allow researchers to assess a greater number of documents in less time. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

This paper describes a robust parsing algorithm for Spoken Language Recognition (SLR) which utilizes a technique that improves the efficiency of parsing. This technique integrates grammatical and statistical approaches, and by using a best-first parsing strategy improves the accuracy of recognition. Preliminary experimental results using a Persian continuous speech recognition system show effective improvements in accuracy with little change in recognition time. The word error rate was also reduced by 18{\%}. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {As text semantics has an important role in text meaning, the term semantics has been seen in a vast sort of text mining studies. However, there is a lack of studies that integrate the different research branches and summarize the developed works. This paper reports a systematic mapping about semantics-concerned text mining studies. This systematic mapping study followed a well-defined protocol. Its results were based on 1693 studies, selected among 3984 studies identified in five digital libraries. The produced mapping gives a general summary of the subject, points some areas that lacks the development of primary or secondary studies, and can be a guide for researchers working with semantics-concerned text mining. It demonstrates that, although several studies have been developed, the processing of semantic aspects in text mining remains an open research problem.},

abstract = {Context: Deep Learning (DL) is a division of machine learning techniques that based on algorithms for learning multiples level of representations. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is the process of examining large scale of data and variety of data types. Objectives: The aims of this study are to identify the existing features of DL approaches for using in BDA and identify the key features that affect the effectiveness of DL approaches. Method: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out and reported based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews. 4065 papers were retrieved by manual search in four databases which are Google Scholar, Taylor {\&} Francis, Springer Link and Science Direct. 34 primary studies were finally included. Result: From these studies, 70{\%} were journal articles, 25{\%} were conference papers and 5{\%} were contributions from the studies consisted of book chapters. Five features of DL were identified and analyzed. The features are (1) hierarchical layer, (2) high-level abstraction, (3) process high volume of data, (4) universal model and (5) does not over fit the training data. Conclusion: This review delivers the evidence that DL in BDA is an active research area. The review provides researchers with some guidelines for future research on this topic. It also provides broad information on DL in BDA which could be useful for practitioners.},

@article{7812765,
abstract = {Sparsity-based approaches have been popular in many applications in image processing and imaging. Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images in a transform domain or dictionary to improve image recovery from undersampled measurements. In the context of inverse problems in dynamic imaging, recent research has demonstrated the promise of sparsity and low-rank techniques. For example, the patches of the underlying data are modeled as sparse in an adaptive dictionary domain, and the resulting image and dictionary estimation from undersampled measurements is called dictionary-blind compressed sensing, or the dynamic image sequence is modeled as a sum of low-rank and sparse (in some transform domain) components (L+S model) that are estimated from limited measurements. In this work, we investigate a data-adaptive extension of the L+S model, dubbed LASSI, where the temporal image sequence is decomposed into a low-rank component and a component whose spatiotemporal (3D) patches are sparse in some adaptive dictionary domain. We investigate various formulations and efficient methods for jointly estimating the underlying dynamic signal components and the spatiotemporal dictionary from limited measurements. We also obtain efficient sparsity penalized dictionary-blind compressed sensing methods as special cases of our LASSI algorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of LASSI schemes for dynamic magnetic resonance image reconstruction from limited k-t space data compared to recent methods such as k-t SLR and L+S, and compared to the proposed dictionary-blind compressed sensing method.},

abstract = {Endogenously produced inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, in particular asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), are currently considered of importance in various disease states characterized by reduced NO availability. We investigated the association between plasma levels of ADMA, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), L-arginine, and citrulline and perinatal factors and outcome in 130 preterm (gestational age ‚â§ 30 weeks) very low birth weight (VLBW, {\textless} 1500 g) infants. Plasma samples were collected 6-12 h after birth. We did not find significant correlations between ADMA, SDMA, L-arginine, and citrulline levels and gestational age or birth weight. However, the arginine:ADMA ratio (AAR, a better indicator of NO availability than either arginine or ADMA separately) was positively correlated with gestational age. ADMA and arginine levels were not significantly different between males and females but males showed a negative correlation between ADMA levels and gestational age. Perinatal factors such as preeclampsia, chrorioamnionitis, prolonged rupture of membranes, or form of delivery did not significantly alter dimethylarginine levels or AAR. In contrast, the AAR was significantly reduced in the infants with respiratory distress, mechanical ventilation, and systemic hypotension Therefore, our data suggest that altered NO availability may play a role in the respiratory and cardiovascular adaptation in preterm VLBW infants.},

Algorithms that filter the list for manual scanning with nearly perfect recall can significantly decrease the workload. This paper presents a novel stopping criterion that estimates the score-distribution of relevant articles from relevance feedback of random articles (S-D Minimal Sampling). Using 20 training and 30 test topics, we achieve a mean recall of 93.3{\%}, filtering out 59.1{\%} of the articles. This approach achieves higher F2-Scores at significantly reduced manual reviewing work loads. The method is especially suited for scenarios with sufficiently many relevant articles ( {\textgreater} 5) that can be sampled and employed for relevance feedback.},

abstract = {Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort. Text classification is useful in determining the statistical significance level of association rules to reduce workload in the systematic review. Several approaches to generate a Rule set for rule based classifiers were proposed in the literature. In this paper, we show that statistic as well as semantic measures of a rule can be combined and effectively computed as a hybrid feature selection rule measure (HFSRM). Moreover, we propose a new algorithm called Rules7-hybrid feature selection (Rules7-HFSRM) by combining the classical algorithm Rules7 and the HFSRM and then used it on the systematic review problem. Our results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms in the systematic review context.},

Besides systematizing the search for relevant studies, the SR predicts the organization and the analysis of the obtained results. However, the SR application is laborious because there are many steps to be followed. Aiming to offer computational support to SR and SM, the StArt (State of the Art through Systematic Review) tool was developed. Besides helping the steps of SR or SM, the StArt tool has implemented visualization and text mining techniques to support the conduction and the reporting of the SR or SM.

abstract = {Huge research effort has been invested over many years to determine the phenotypes of natural or artificial mutations in HIV proteins--interpretation of mutation phenotypes is an invaluable source of new knowledge. The results of this research effort are recorded in the scientific literature, but it is difficult for virologists to rapidly find it. Manually locating data on phenotypic variation within the approximately 270,000 available HIV-related research articles, or the further 1,500 articles that are published each month is a daunting task. Accordingly, the HIV research community would benefit from a resource cataloguing the available HIV mutation literature. We have applied computational text-mining techniques to parse and map mutagenesis and polymorphism information from the HIV literature, have enriched the data with ancillary information and have developed a public, web-based interface through which it can be intuitively explored: the HIV mutation browser. The current release of the HIV mutation browser describes the phenotypes of 7,608 unique mutations at 2,520 sites in the HIV proteome, resulting from the analysis of 120,899 papers. The mutation information for each protein is organised in a residue-centric manner and each residue is linked to the relevant experimental literature. The importance of HIV as a global health burden advocates extensive effort to maximise the efficiency of HIV research. The HIV mutation browser provides a valuable new resource for the research community. The HIV mutation browser is available at: http://hivmut.org.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether SVM-based classifiers, which are trained on a combination of inclusion and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new systematic reviews. Methods: Test collections were built using the annotated reference files from 19 procedure and 4 drug systematic reviews. The classifiers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of included and commonly excluded articles and one with a combination of included and excluded articles. AUCs were used as evaluation metrics. Results: The AUCs of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and commonly excluded articles, were significantly higher than those of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and excluded articles. Conclusion: Automatic, high-quality article classifiers using machine learning could reduce the workload of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-specific data are scarce. In particular, when used as training data, a combination of included and commonly excluded articles is more helpful than a combination of included and excluded articles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Context: An enormous number of papers (more than 70,000) have been published in the area of Software Engineering (SE) since its inception in 1968. To better characterize and understand this massive research literature, there is a need for comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Objective: The objective of this study is to utilize automated citation and topic analysis to characterize the software engineering research literature over the years. While a few bibliometrics studies have appeared in the field of SE, this article aims to be the most comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Method: To achieve the above objective, we report in this paper a bibliometrics study with data collected from Scopus database consisting of over 70,000 articles. For thematic analysis, we used topic modeling to automatically generate the most probable topic distributions given the data.Results: We found that number of papers published per year has grown tremendously and currently 6000-7000 papers are published every year. At the same time, nearly half of the papers are not cited at all. Using text mining of articles titles, we found that currently the hot research topics in software engineering are: (1) web services, (2) mobile and cloud computing, (3) industrial (case) studies, (4) source code and (5) test generation. Finally, we found that a small share of large countries produce the majority of the papers in SE while small European countries are proportionally the most active in the area of SE, based on the number of papers.Conclusion: Due to large volumes of research in SE, we suggest using the automated analysis of bibliometrics as we have done in this paper. By picking out the most cited papers, we can present the land marks of SE and, with thematic analysis, we can characterize the entire field. This can be useful for students and other new comers to SE and for presenting our achievements to other disciplines. In particular, we see and report the value of such an analysis in situations where performing a full scale SLR is not feasible due to restrictions on time or to lack of exact research questions.},

abstract = {With the increasing number and diversity of search tools available, interest in the evaluation of search systems, particularly from a user perspective, has grown among researchers. More researchers are designing and evaluating interactive information retrieval (IIR) systems and beginning to innovate in evaluation methods. Maturation of a research specialty relies on the ability to replicate research, provide standards for measurement and analysis, and understand past endeavors. This article presents a historical overview of 40 years of IIR evaluation studies using the method of systematic review. A total of 2,791 journal and conference units were manually examined and 127 articles were selected for analysis in this study, based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. These articles were systematically coded using features such as author, publication date, sources and references, and properties of the research method used in the articles, such as number of subjects, tasks, corpora, and measures. Results include data describing the growth of IIR studies over time, the most frequently occurring and cited authors and sources, and the most common types of corpora and measures used. An additional product of this research is a bibliography of IIR evaluation research that can be used by students, teachers, and those new to the area. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first historical, systematic characterization of the IIR evaluation literature, including the documentation of methods and measures used by researchers in this specialty.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the evidence for symbolic regression using genetic programming (GP) being an effective method for prediction and estimation in software engineering, when compared with regression/machine learning models and other comparison groups (including comparisons with different improvements over the standard GP algorithm). We performed a systematic review of literature that compared genetic programming models with comparative techniques based on different independent project variables. A total of 23 primary studies were obtained after searching different information sources in the time span 1995-2008. The results of the review show that symbolic regression using genetic programming has been applied in three domains within software engineering predictive modeling: (i) Software quality classification (eight primary studies). (ii) Software cost/effort/size estimation (seven primary studies). (iii) Software fault prediction/software reliability growth modeling (eight primary studies). While there is evidence in support of using genetic programming for software quality classification, software fault prediction and software reliability growth modeling; the results are inconclusive for software cost/effort/size estimation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Spam is information crafted to be delivered to a large number of recipients, in spite of their wishes. A spam filter is an automated tool to recognize spam so as to prevent its delivery. The purposes of spam and spam filters are diametrically opposed: spam is effective if it evades filters, while a filter is effective if it recognizes spam. The circular nature of these definitions, along with their appeal to the intent of sender and recipient make them difficult to formalize. A typical email user has a working definition no more formal than "I know it when I see it." Yet, current spam filters are remarkably effective, more effective than might be expected given the level of uncertainty and debate over a formal definition of spam, more effective than might be expected given the state-of-the-art information retrieval and machine learning methods for seemingly similar problems. But are they effective enough? Which are better? How might they be improved? Will their effectiveness be compromised by more cleverly crafted spam? We survey current and proposed spam filtering techniques with particular emphasis on how well they work. Our primary focus is spam filtering in email; Similarities and differences with spam filtering in other communication and storage media - such as instant messaging and the Web - are addressed peripherally. In doing so we examine the definition of spam, the user's information requirements and the role of the spam filter as one component of a large and complex information universe. Well-known methods are detailed sufficiently to make the exposition self-contained, however, the focus is on considerations unique to spam. Comparisons, wherever possible, use common evaluation measures, and control for differences in experimental setup. Such comparisons are not easy, as benchmarks, measures, and methods for evaluating spam filters are still evolving. We survey these efforts, their results and their limitations. In spite of recent advances in evaluation methodology, many uncertainties (including widely held but unsubstantiated beliefs) remain as to the effectiveness of spam filtering techniques and as to the validity of spam filter evaluation methods. We outline several uncertainties and propose experimental methods to address them.},

abstract = {We report on our research in using literature-based discovery (LBD) to provide pharmacological and/or pharmacogenomic explanations for reported adverse drug effects. The goal of LBD is to generate novel and potentially useful hypotheses by analyzing the scientific literature and optionally some additional resources. Our assumption is that drugs have effects on some genes or proteins and that these genes or proteins are associated with the observed adverse effects. Therefore, by using LBD we try to find genes or proteins that link the drugs with the reported adverse effects. These genes or proteins can be used to provide insight into the processes causing the adverse effects. Initial results show that our method has the potential to assist in explaining reported adverse drug effects. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Rapid growth of sensor and computing platforms have introduced the wearable systems. In recent years, wearable systems have led to new applications across all medical fields. The aim of this review is to present current state-of-the-art approach in the field of wearable system based cancer detection and identify key challenges that resist it from clinical adoption. A total of 472 records were screened and 11 were finally included in this study. Two types of records were studied in this context that includes 45{\%} research articles and 55{\%} manufactured products. The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3{\%}), skin cancer (36.3{\%}), prostate cancer (18.1{\%}), and multi-type cancer (9{\%}). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system. It is well comprehended that upon sincere orientation of all identified challenges, wearable systems would emerge as vital alternative to futuristic cancer detection.},

abstract = {Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.},

RQ1: Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM 

RQ2: a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach; Previous findings reported by Malheiros et al. [10] show that the use of VTM reduces the time taken to perform the selection activity and also improves the number of papers correctly included or excluded in SLRs.

RQ3: time taken - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; 
effectiveness - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; Table 1
Our results showed that the time taken by students 1 and 2 to perform the study selection activity on the basis of reading the abstracts was 85 and 54 minutes respectively; and the time taken by students 3 and 4 to perform the same activity using the VTM approach was 30 and 58 minutes respectively. The performance of the students using the VTM appeared to be either equivalent to or better than that of the students using the manual method.

RQ4: to support the primary study selection activity

abstract = {This paper describes the participation of the LIMSI-MIROR team at CLEF eHealth 2017, task 2. The task addresses the automatic ranking of articles in order to assist with the screening process of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) Systematic Reviews. We used a logistic regression classifier and handled class imbalance using a combination of class reweighting and undersampling. We also experimented with two strategies for relevance feedback. Our best run obtained an overall Average Precision of 0.179 and Work Saved over Sampling @95{\%} Recall of 0.650. This run uses stochastic gradient descent for training but no feature selection or relevance feedback. We observe high performance variation within the queries in the test set. Nonetheless, our results suggest that automatic assistance is promising for ranking the DTA literature as it could reduce the screening workload for review writer by 65{\%} on average.},

abstract = {Alignment of parallel corpora is a crucial step prior to training statistical language models for machine translation. This paper investigates compression-based methods for aligning sentences in an English-Chinese parallel corpus. Four metrics for matching sentences required for measuring the alignment at the sentence level are compared: the standard sentence length ratio (SLR), and three new metrics, absolute sentence length difference (SLD), compression code length ratio (CR), and absolute compression code length difference (CD). Initial experiments with CR show that using the Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) compression scheme, a method that also performs well at many language modeling tasks, significantly outperforms the other standard compression algorithms Gzip and Bzip2. The paper then shows that for sentence alignment of a parallel corpus with ground truth judgments, the compression code length ratio using PPM always performs better than sentence length ratio and the difference measurements also work better than the ratio measurements. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {Within the framework of the strategic research project Xsense at the Technical University of Denmark, we are developing a colorimetric sensor array which can be useful for detection of explosives like DNT, TNT, HMX, RDX and TATP and identification of volatile organic compounds in the presence of water vapor in air. In order to analyze colorimetric sensors with statistical methods, the sensory output must be put into numerical form suitable for analysis. We present new ways of extracting features from a colorimetric sensor and determine the quality and robustness of these features using machine learning classifiers. Sensors, and in particular explosive sensors, must not only be able to classify explosives, they must also be able to measure the certainty of the classifier regarding the decision it has made. This means there is a need for classifiers that not only give a decision, but also give a posterior probability about the decision. We will compare K-nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks and sparse logistic regression for colorimetric sensor data analysis. Using the sparse solutions we perform feature selection and feature ranking and compare to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.},

abstract = {The manufacturing industry is currently in the midst of a data-driven revolution, which promises to transform traditional manufacturing facilities in to highly optimised smart manufacturing facilities. These smart facilities are focused on creating manufacturing intelligence from real-time data to support accurate and timely decision-making that can have a positive impact across the entire organisation. To realise these efficiencies emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) will be embedded in physical processes to measure and monitor real-time data from across the factory, which will ultimately give rise to unprecedented levels of data production. Therefore, manufacturing facilities must be able to manage the demands of exponential increase in data production, as well as possessing the analytical techniques needed to extract meaning from these large datasets. More specifically, organisations must be able to work with big data technologies to meet the demands of smart manufacturing. However, as big data is a relatively new phenomenon and potential applications to manufacturing activities are wide-reaching and diverse, there has been an obvious lack of secondary research undertaken in the area. Without secondary research, it is difficult for researchers to identify gaps in the field, as well as aligning their work with other researchers to develop strong research themes. In this study, we use the formal research methodology of systematic mapping to provide a breadth-first review of big data technologies in manufacturing.},

abstract = {Awareness that disease susceptibility is not only dependent on genetic make up, but can be affected by lifestyle decisions, has brought more attention to the role of diet. However, food is often treated as a black box, or the focus is limited to few, well-studied compounds, such as polyphenols, lipids and nutrients. In this work, we applied text mining and Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classification to assemble the knowledge space of food-phytochemical and food-disease associations, where we distinguish between disease prevention/amelioration and disease progression. We subsequently searched for frequently occurring phytochemical-disease pairs and we identified 20,654 phytochemicals from 16,102 plants associated to 1,592 human disease phenotypes. We selected colon cancer as a case study and analyzed our results in three directions; i) one stop legacy knowledge-shop for the effect of food on disease, ii) discovery of novel bioactive compounds with drug-like properties, and iii) discovery of novel health benefits from foods. This works represents a systematized approach to the association of food with health effect, and provides the phytochemical layer of information for nutritional systems biology research.},

abstract = {A sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention from researchers working in the fields of natural language processing and text mining. However, there is a lack of annotated data sets that can be used to train a model for all domains, which is hampering the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Many research studies have attempted to tackle this issue and to improve cross-domain sentiment classification. In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive systematic literature review of the methods and techniques employed in a cross-domain sentiment analysis. We focus on studies published during the period of 2010-2016. From our analysis of those works, it is clear that there is no perfect solution. Hence, one of the aims of this review is to create a resource in the form of an overview of the techniques, methods, and approaches that have been used to attempt to solve the problem of cross-domain sentiment analysis in order to assist researchers in developing new and more accurate techniques in the future.},

abstract = {Preparing a systematic review can take hundreds of hours to complete, but the process of reconciling different results from multiple studies is the bedrock of evidence-based medicine. We introduce a two-step approach to automatically extract three facets - two entities (the agent and object) and the way in which the entities are compared (the endpoint) - from direct comparative sentences in full-text articles. The system does not require a user to predefine entities in advance and thus can be used in domains where entity recognition is difficult or unavailable. As with a systematic review, the tabular summary produced using the automatically extracted facets shows how experimental results differ between studies. Experiments were conducted using a collection of more than 2million sentences from three journals Diabetes, Carcinogenesis and Endocrinology and two machine learning algorithms, support vector machines (SVM) and a general linear model (GLM). F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and accuracy measures for the SVM and GLM differed by only 0.01 across all three comparison facets in a randomly selected set of test sentences. The system achieved the best performance of 92{\%} for objects, whereas the accuracy for both agent and endpoints was 73{\%}. F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} scores were higher for objects (0.77) than for endpoints (0.51) or agents (0.47). A situated evaluation of Metformin, a drug to treat diabetes, showed system accuracy of 95{\%}, 83{\%} and 79{\%} for the object, endpoint and agent respectively. The situated evaluation had higher F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} scores of 0.88, 0.64 and 0.62 for object, endpoint, and agent respectively. On average, only 5.31{\%} of the sentences in a full-text article are direct comparisons, but the tabular summaries suggest that these sentences provide a rich source of currently underutilized information that can be used to accelerate the systematic review process and identify gaps where future research should be focused.},

abstract = {Objective: The occurrence of pain accounts for billions of dollars in annual medical expenditures; loss of quality of life and decreased worker productivity contribute to indirect costs. As pain is highly subjective, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can be critical for improving the accuracy of pain assessment and offering better support for clinical decision-making. This review is focused on computer technologies for pain management that allow CDSSs to obtain knowledge from the clinical data produced by either patients or health care professionals. Methods and materials: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases to identify relevant articles focused on computerised systems that constituted CDSSs and include data or results related to pain symptoms from patients with acute or chronic pain, published between 1992 and 2011 in the English language. In total, thirty-nine studies were analysed; thirty-two were selected from 1245 citations, and seven were obtained from reference tracking. Results: The results highlighted the following clusters of computer technologies: rule-based algorithms, artificial neural networks, nonstandard set theory, and statistical learning algorithms. In addition, several methodologies were found for content processing such as terminologies, questionnaires, and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53{\%} to 87.5{\%}. Conclusions: Computer technologies that have been applied in CDSSs are important but not determinant in improving the systems' accuracy and the clinical practice, as evidenced by the moderate correlation among the studies. However, these systems play an important role in the design of computerised systems oriented to a patient's symptoms as is required for pain management. Several limitations related to CDSSs were observed: the lack of integration with mobile devices, the reduced use of web-based interfaces, and scarce capabilities for data to be inserted by patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Opinion mining is the process of extracting human thoughts and perceptions from unstructured texts, which with regard to the emergence of online social media and mass volume of users' comments, has become to a useful, attractive and also challenging issue. There are varieties of researches with different trends and approaches in this area, but the lack of a comprehensive study to investigate them from all aspects is tangible. In this paper we represent a complete, multilateral and systematic review of opinion mining and sentiment analysis to classify available methods and compare their advantages and drawbacks, in order to have better understanding of available challenges and solutions to clarify the future direction. For this purpose, we present a proper framework of opinion mining accompanying with its steps and levels and then we completely monitor, classify, summarize and compare proposed techniques for aspect extraction, opinion classification, summary production and evaluation, based on the major validated scientific works. In order to have a better comparison, we also propose some factors in each category, which help to have a better understanding of advantages and disadvantages of different methods. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature},

abstract = {Context Independent validation of published scientific results through study replication is a pre-condition for accepting the validity of such results. In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field. Objective In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility. Methods The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach. Results Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80{\%} of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27{\%} of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available. Conclusions The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced.},

abstract = {A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) identifies, evaluates, and synthesizes the literature available for a given topic. This generally requires a significant human workload and has subjectivity bias that could affect the results of such a review. Automated document classification can be a valuable tool for recommending the selection of studies. In this article, we propose an automated pre-selection approach based on text mining and semantic enrichment techniques. Each document is firstly processed by a named entity extractor. The DBpedia URIs coming from the entity linking process are used as external sources of information. Our system collects the bag of words of those sources and it adds them to the initial document. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier discriminates whether the enriched document belongs to the positive example set or not. We used an existing manually performed SLR as benchmark data set. We trained our system with different configurations of relevant documents and we tested the goodness of our approach with an empirical assessment. Results show a reduction of the manual workload of 18{\%} that a human researcher has to spend, while holding a remarkable 95{\%} of recall, important condition for the nature itself of SLRs. We measure the effect of the enrichment process to the precision of the classifier and we observed a gain up to 5{\%}.},

A range of possibilities have emerged from this type of environment, such as improvements in distance education and other educational technologies. But there are some problems related to the use of this environment, such as complex authorship tools, which need to be discussed and considered to create situations that encourage use. The goal of this study was to find, analyze, and discuss the studies that focused on these environments, with authorship as the main theme. With this in mind, we conducted a systematic review of published articles in six repositories to extract studies for subsequent analysis using text mining and graph analysis software.},

Although previous research attempted this task with simple models, weve made several improvements in our approach aiming to take into account interactions among heroes in the draft. For that purpose we've tested the following machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes classifier, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. We also introduced Factorization Machines for that task and got our best results from them. Besides that, we found that model's prediction accuracy depends on skill level of the players. We've prepared publicly available dataset which takes into account shortcomings of data used in previous research and can be used further for algorithms development, testing and benchmarking.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of the targeted use of malware in cyber espionage versus industry requires a systematic review for better understanding of its impact and mechanism. This paper proposes a basic taxonomy to document major cyber espionage incidents, describing and comparing their impacts (geographic or political targets, origins and motivations) and their mechanisms (dropper, propagation, types of operating systems and infection rates). This taxonomy provides information on recent cyber espionage attacks that can aid in defense against cyber espionage by providing both scholars and experts a solid foundation of knowledge about the topic. The classification also provides a systematic way to document known and future attacks to facilitate research activities. Geopolitical and international relations researchers can focus on the impacts, and malware and security experts can focus on the mechanisms. We identify several dominant patterns (e.g., the prevalent use of remote access Trojan and social engineering). This article concludes that the research and professional community should collaborate to build an open data set to facilitate the geopolitical and/or technical analysis and synthesis of the role of malware in cyber espionage.},

abstract = {In the auditory cortex, onset activities have been extensively investigated as a cortical representation of sound information such as sound frequency. Yet, less attention has been paid to date to steady-state activities following the onset activities. In this study, we used machine learning to investigate whether steady-state activities in the presence of continuous sounds represent the sound frequency. Sparse Logistic Regression (SLR) decoded the sound frequency from band specific power or phase locking value (PLV) of local field potentials (LFP) from the fourth layer of the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats. Consequently, we found that SLR was able to decode the sound frequency from steady-state neural activities as well as onset activities. This result demonstrates that the steady-state activities contain information about the sound such as sound frequency.},

abstract = {We address the problem of transmit beamforming under channel uncertainty for a multiuser (MU), single carrier frequency domain equalization multiple input multiple output (SC-FDE-MIMO) system. SC-FDE-MIMO scheme is effective solution with relative low complexity to combat inter -symbol interference (ISI) whilst exploiting multi antennas diversity gain. In our system, the signal to leakage ratio (SLR) criterion is used to design the transmit beamformer and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is employed for the receiver equalization and combining. Non-robust beamforming techniques require perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge which is not available in practice. In this paper, we propose a robust transmit beamformer which can successfully tolerate CSI imperfection. Diagonal loading is employed to introduce robustness to channel state information errors. The novelty of this work, however, is the application of the robust beamforming in the context of downlink MU-SC transmission. Average bit error (BER) simulations are presented to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic Reviews are extremely dependent on human effort and, therefore, costly and time consuming. Some authors in Software Engineering are starting to research the use of computer support to reduce human labor in some tasks of the process. Aim: Define a method for automatic location of sentences that describe the results in an unstructured scientific paper aiming to reduce the human effort. Method: Three sentence classification methods were analyzed and a new sentence classification method was proposed and tested with the same input set used in the other methods. Results: The method proposed in this work reached rates ranged between 60{\%} and 72{\%} of recall of the sentences describing results of the papers. Conclusions: The proximity between the recall rates found in automatic tests conducted with the proposed method and in a test with humans confirms the feasibility of this technique for automating part of the process.},

@article{Kontonatsios2017a,
abstract = {Citation screening, an integral process within systematic reviews that identifies citations relevant to the underlying research question, is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. During the screening task, analysts manually assign a label to each citation, to designate whether a citation is eligible for inclusion in the review. Recently, several studies have explored the use of active learning in text classification to reduce the human workload involved in the screening task. However, existing approaches require a significant amount of manually labelled citations for the text classification to achieve a robust performance. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method that identifies relevant citations as early as possible in the screening process by exploiting the pairwise similarities between labelled and unlabelled citations to improve the classification performance without additional manual labelling effort. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that similar citations share the same label (e.g., if one citation should be included, then other similar citations should be included also). To calculate the similarity between labelled and unlabelled citations we investigate two different feature spaces, namely a bag-of-words and a spectral embedding based on the bag-of-words. The semi-supervised method propagates the classification codes of manually labelled citations to neighbouring unlabelled citations in the feature space. The automatically labelled citations are combined with the manually labelled citations to form an augmented training set. For evaluation purposes, we apply our method to reviews from clinical and public health. The results show that our semi-supervised method with label propagation achieves statistically significant improvements over two state-of-the-art active learning approaches across both clinical and public health reviews.},

This task, known in Information Retrieval as the total recall problem, requires long and tedious search sessions by experts in the field of medicine. Automatic (or semi-automatic) approaches are essential to support these type of searches when the amount of data exceed the limits of users, i.e. in terms of attention or patience.

abstract = {Forecasting share performance becomes more challenging issue due to the enormous amount of valuable trading data stored in the stock database. Currently, existing forecasting methods are insufficient to analyze the share performance accurately. There are two main reasons for that: First, the study of existing forecasting methods is still insufficient to identify the most suitable methods for share price prediction. Second, the lack of investigations made on the factors affecting the share performance. In this regard, this study presents a systematic review of the last fifteen years on various machine learning techniques in order to analyze share performance accurately. The only objective of this study is to provide an overview of the machine learning techniques that have been used to forecast share performance. This paper also highlights a how the prediction algorithms can be used to identify the most important variables in a share market dataset. Finally, we could have succeeded to analyze share performance effectively. It could bring benefits and impacts to researchers, society, brokers and financial analysts.},

abstract = {Objective: Literature database search is a crucial step in the development of clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews. In the age of information technology, the process of literature search is still conducted manually, therefore it is costly, slow and subject to human errors. In this research, we sought to improve the traditional search approach using innovative query expansion and citation ranking approaches. Methods: We developed a citation retrieval system composed of query expansion and citation ranking methods. The methods are unsupervised and easily integrated over the PubMed search engine. To validate the system, we developed a gold standard consisting of citations that were systematically searched and screened to support the development of cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines. The expansion and ranking methods were evaluated separately and compared with baseline approaches. Results: Compared with the baseline PubMed expansion, the query expansion algorithm improved recall (80.2{\%} vs. 51.5{\%}) with small loss on precision (0.4{\%} vs. 0.6{\%}). The algorithm could find all citations used to support a larger number of guideline recommendations than the baseline approach (64.5{\%} vs. 37.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). In addition, the citation ranking approach performed better than PubMed's "most recent" ranking (average precision +6.5{\%}, recall at k +21.1{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), PubMed's rank by "relevance" (average precision +6.1{\%}, recall at k +14.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), and the machine learning classifier that identifies scientifically sound studies from MEDLINE citations (average precision +4.9{\%}, recall at k +4.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: Our unsupervised query expansion and ranking techniques are more flexible and effective than PubMed's default search engine behavior and the machine learning classifier. Automated citation finding is promising to augment the traditional literature search.},

Text mining had been used extensively to analyze English text. However, text mining has only been used recently in analyzing Arabic text. As a result the objective of this paper is to present the current state of Arabic text mining. A systematic review has been performed to collect the papers published on the analysis of Arabic text mining. More than one hundred papers were used in our review from different reliable sources, and then they were classified according to their specific domain, and classified again according to the specific techniques used. This paper also provides quantitative analysis of publications according to publication type, year, category, and contributors.},

abstract = {Context: Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system. In order to improve estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based SDEE models (ML models) since 1990s. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Objective: This research aims to systematically analyze ML models from four aspects: type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context. Method: We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ML model published in the last two decades (1991-2010). Results: We have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research. After investigating these studies, we found that eight types of ML techniques have been employed in SDEE models. Overall speaking, the estimation accuracy of these ML models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non-ML models. Furthermore, different ML models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts. Conclusion: ML models are promising in the field of SDEE. However, the application of ML models in industry is still limited, so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ML models. To this end, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become an established methodology in software engineering (SE) research however they can be very time consuming and error prone. Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Recurrence is an important cornerstone in breast cancer behavior, intrinsically related to mortality. In spite of its relevance, it is rarely recorded in the majority of breast cancer datasets, which makes research in its prediction more difficult. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques applied to the prediction of breast cancer recurrence. Material and Methods: Revision of published works that used machine learning techniques in local and open source databases between 1997 and 2014. Results: The revision showed that it is difficult to obtain a representative dataset for breast cancer recurrence and there is no consensus on the best set of predictors for this disease. High accuracy results are often achieved, yet compromising sensitivity. The missing data and class imbalance problems are rarely addressed and most often the chosen performance metrics are inappropriate for the context. Discussion and Conclusions: Although different techniques have been used, prediction of breast cancer recurrence is still an open problem. The combination of different machine learning techniques, along with the definition of standard predictors for breast cancer recurrence seem to be the main future directions to obtain better results.},

abstract = {This paper aims to present a systematic literature review of research in music information seeking and its application to musical creativity and creative activities and in particular composition, performance and improvisation, and listening and analysis. A seed set of 901 articles published between 1973 and 2015 was evaluated and in total 65 studies were considered for further analyses. Data extraction and synthesis was performed through content analysis using the PRISMA method. Three thematic categories were identified in regard to music information needs: (a) those related to scholarly activities, (b) musically motivated, as well as (c) those which are related to socializing and communication. In addition, 3 categories of music information sources were connected to musical creativity: (i) those that are related to Internet and media technologies, (ii) those that are related to music libraries, organizations, and music stores, and (iii) those that are related to the subjects' social settings. The paper provides a systematic review, with the aim of showcasing the effect of modern information retrieval techniques in a creative and intensive area of information-dependent activity such as music making and consumption.},

abstract = {Ambiguity in natural language requirements has long been recognized as an inevitable challenge in requirements engineering (RE). Various initiatives have been taken by RE researchers to address the challenges of ambiguity. In this paper the results of a mapping study are presented that focus on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for addressing ambiguity in requirements. Systematic review of the literature resulted in 174 studies on the subject published during 1995 to 2015, and out of these only 28 are empirically evaluated studies that were selected. From of the resulting set of papers, 81{\%} have focused on detecting ambiguity; whereas 4{\%} and 5{\%} are focusing on reducing and removing ambiguity respectively. Addressing syntactic, semantic, and lexical ambiguities has attracted more attention than other types. In spite of all the research efforts, there is a lack of empirical evaluation of NLP tools and techniques for addressing ambiguity in requirements. The results have pointed out some gaps in empirical results and have raised questions the designing of an analytical framework for research in this field. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Text summarization has grew so uses such as Due to the enormous aggregate of information getting augmented on internet; it is challenging for the user to verve through altogether the information accessible on web. The large availability of internet content partakes constrained a broad research area in the extent of automatic text summarization contained by the Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially statistical machine learning communal. Terminated the bygone half a century, the defaulting has been addressed from numerous diverse standpoints, in erratic domains and using innumerable archetypes. In this survey paper we investigate the popular and important work done in the field of single and multiple document summarizations, generous distinctive prominence towards pragmatic approaches and extractive techniques. Particular auspicious slants that quintessence on unambiguous minutiae of the summarization are also deliberated. Exceptional consideration is ardent to involuntary assessment of summarization classifications, as forthcoming investigation on summarization is sturdily reliant over evolvement in this problem space.},

abstract = {Imagine a physician and a patient doing a search on antibiotic resistance. Or a chess amateur and a grandmaster conducting a search on Alekhine's Defence. Although the topic is the same, arguably the two users in each case will satisfy their information needs with very different texts. Yet today search engines mostly adopt the one-size-fits-all solution, where personalization is restricted to topical preference. We found that users do not uniformly prefer simple texts, and that the text comprehensibility level should match the user's level of preparedness. Consequently, we propose to model the comprehensibility of texts as well as the users' reading proficiency in order to better explain how different users choose content for further exploration. We also model topic-specific reading proficiency, which allows us to better explain why a physician might choose to read sophisticated medical articles yet simple descriptions of SLR cameras. We explore different ways to build user profiles, and use collaborative filtering techniques to overcome data sparsity. We conducted experiments on large-scale datasets from a major Web search engine and a community question answering forum. Our findings confirm that explicitly modeling text comprehensibility can significantly improve content ranking (search results or answers, respectively).},

Prediction of change prone classes leads to higher quality, maintainable software with low cost. This study reports a systematic review of change prediction studies published in journals and conference proceedings. This review will help researchers and practitioners to examine the previous studies from different viewpoints: metrics, data analysis techniques, datasets, and experimental results perspectives. Besides this, the research questions formulated in the review allow us to identify gaps in the current technology. The key findings of the review are: (i) less use of method level metrics, machine learning methods and commercial datasets; (ii) inappropriate use of performance measures and statistical tests; (iii) lack of use of feature reduction techniques; (iv) lack of risk indicators used for identifying change prone classes and (v) inappropriate use of validation methods. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing popularity of systematic literature reviews in Software Engineering, several researchers still indicate it as a costly and challenging process. Aiming at alleviating this costly process, we propose an iterative method to support the process of building the search string for a systematic review. This method uses Visual Text Mining techniques to support the researcher by suggesting new terms for the string. In order to do so, the method extracts relevant terms from studies selected by the researcher and displays them in a way that facilitate their visualization and supports building and refining the search string. In order to check the feasibility of this approach, we developed a tool that implements the proposed method. Interviews with researchers identified their difficulties in performing systematic reviews and captured their feedback with regards the use of the proposed method in a user study. The researchers indicated that this approach could be used to improve the process of building the search strings for systematic reviews. The study indicates that our approach can be used to facilitate the construction of the systematic literature review search string. Copyright 2015 ACM.},
