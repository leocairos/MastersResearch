abstract = {The presentation of results from Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) is generally done using tables. Prior research suggests that results summarized in tables are often difficult for readers to understand. One alternative to improve results' comprehensibility is to use graphical representations. The aim of this work is twofold: first, to investigate whether graph representations result is better comprehensibility than tables when presenting SLR results; second, to investigate whether interpretation using graphs impacts on performance, as measured by the time consumed to analyse and understand the data. We selected an SLR published in the literature and used two different formats to represent its results - tables and graphs, in three different combinations: (i) table format only; (ii) graph format only; and (iii) a mixture of tables and graphs. We conducted an experiment that compared the performance and capability of experts in SLR, as well as doctoral and masters students, in analysing and understanding the results of the SLR, as presented in one of the three different forms. We were interested in examining whether there is difference between the performance of participants using tables and graphs. The graphical representation of SLR data led to a reduction in the time taken for its analysis, without any loss in data comprehensibility. For our sample the analysis of graphical data proved to be faster than the analysis of tabular data. However, we found no evidence of a difference in comprehensibility whether using tables, graphical format or a combination. Overall we argue that graphs are a suitable alternative to tables when it comes to representing the results of an SLR. {\&}copy; 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Medical systematic reviews answer particular questions within a very specific domain of expertise by selecting and analysing the current pertinent literature. As part of this process, the phase of screening articles usually requires a long time and significant effort as it involves a group of domain experts evaluating thousands of articles in order to find the relevant instances. Our goal is to support this process through automatic tools. There is a recent trend of applying text classification methods to semi-automate the screening phase by providing decision support to the group of experts, hence helping reduce the required time and effort. In this work, we contribute to this line of work by performing a comprehensive set of text classification experiments on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review in the area of Internet-Based Randomised Controlled Trials. These experiments involved applying multiple machine learning algorithms combined with several feature selection techniques to different parts of the articles (i.e., titles, abstract, or both). Results are generally positive in terms of overall precision and recall measurements, reaching values of up to 84{\%}. It is also revealing in terms of how using only article titles provides virtually as good results as when adding article abstracts. Based on the positive results, it is clear that text classification can support the screening stage of medical systematic reviews. However, selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms, related methods, and text sections of articles is a neglected but important requirement because of its significant impact to the end results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study aims to systematically review the cross disciplinary literature covering the time period from 1934 to January 2013 on behavioral operations in supply chain in order to identify and define the taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. A list of noted journals and search results from Science Direct and Web of Knowledge, IEEE Xplore, and INFORMS (approximately 11,000 journal articles) is used to prepare content collection. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is applied as the review and knowledge extraction methodology. Using the text analysis and mining method we can combine statistical methods and expert human judgment to extract knowledge in the form of key latent factors. The LSA based analysis gives the study a scientific grounding which helps to overcome the subjectivity of collective opinion about the trends. This approach allows proposing taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. The adopted systems approach is used to find research gaps in each class of taxonomy. An emerging trend is noticed in the research of behavioral operations in supply chain. Understanding such a scholarly structure and future trends will assist researchers to assimilate the divergent developments of this multidisciplinary research in one place. This review will be beneficial for practitioners as they consider behavioral aspects in decision making. We have also studied articles related to supply chain published in Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA) journal. We have speculated what an ESWA-related community would like to see in future publications. This will encourage researchers to explore the recommended areas and publish to these outlets.},

abstract = {In order to preserve the value of Systematic Reviews (SRs), they should be frequently updated considering new evidence that has been produced since the completion of the previous version of the reviews. However, the update of an SR is a time consuming, manual task. Thus, many SRs have not been updated as they should be and, therefore, they are currently outdated. Objective: The main contribution of this paper is to support the update of SRs. Method: We propose USR-VTM, an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques, to support selection of new evidence in the form of primary studies. We then present a tool, named Revis, which supports our approach. Finally, we evaluate our approach through a comparison of outcomes achieved using USR-VTM versus the traditional (manual) approach. Results: Our results show that USR-VTM increases the number of studies correctly included compared to the traditional approach. Conclusions: USR-VTM effectively supports the update of SRs.},

abstract = {In systematic reviews, the growing number of published studies imposes a significant screening workload on reviewers. Active learning is a promising approach to reduce the workload by automating some of the screening decisions, but it has been evaluated for a limited number of disciplines. The suitability of applying active learning to complex topics in disciplines such as social science has not been studied, and the selection of useful criteria and enhancements to address the data imbalance problem in systematic reviews remains an open problem. We applied active learning with two criteria (certainty and uncertainty) and several enhancements in both clinical medicine and social science (specifically, public health) areas, and compared the results in both. The results show that the certainty criterion is useful for finding relevant documents, and weighting positive instances is promising to overcome the data imbalance problem in both data sets. Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is also shown to be promising when little manually-assigned information is available. Active learning is effective in complex topics, although its efficiency is limited due to the difficulties in text classification. The most promising criterion and weighting method are the same regardless of the review topic, and unsupervised techniques like LDA have a possibility to boost the performance of active learning without manual annotation.},

They are fundamental tools for evidence-based medicine. In this paper, we show that automatic text classification can be useful in building systematic reviews for medical topics to speed up the reviewing process. We propose a per-question classification method that uses an ensemble of classifiers that exploit the particular protocol of a systematic review. We also show that when integrating the classifier in the human workflow of building a review the per-question method is superior to the global method.

abstract = {Comparative effectiveness reviews (CERs), a central methodology of comparative effectiveness research, are increasingly used to inform healthcare decisions. During these systematic reviews of the scientific literature, the reviewers (MD-methodologists) must screen several thousands of citations for eligibility according to a pre-specified protocol. While previous research has demonstrated the theoretical potential of machine learning to reduce the workload in CERs, practical obstacles to deploying such a system remain. In this article, we describe work on an end-to-end, interactive machine learning system for assisting reviewers with the tedious task of citation screening for CERs. Specifically, we present ABSTRACKR, our open-source annotation tool. In addition to allowing reviewers to designate citations as 'relevant' or 'irrelevant' to the review at hand, ABSTRACKR facilitates communicating other information useful to the classification model, such as terms that are suggestive of the relevance (or irrelevance) of a citation. The tool also records the time taken to screen citations, over which we conducted a time-series analysis to derive an annotator model. Using this model, we found that both the order in which the citations are screened and the length of each citation affect annotation time. We propose a strategy that integrates labeled terms and timing data into the Active Learning (AL) framework, in which an algorithm selects citations for the reviewer to label. We demonstrate empirically that this additional information can improve the performance of the semi-automated citation screening system.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether the automatic classification of documents can be useful in systematic reviews on medical topics, and specifically if the performance of the automatic classification can be enhanced by using the particular protocol of questions employed by the human reviewers to create multiple classifiers. Methods and materials: The test collection is the data used in large-scale systematic review on the topic of the dissemination strategy of health care services for elderly people. From a group of 47,274 abstracts marked by human reviewers to be included in or excluded from further screening, we randomly selected 20,000 as a training set, with the remaining 27,274 becoming a separate test set. As a machine learning algorithm we used complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes. We tested both a global classification method, where a single classifier is trained on instances of abstracts and their classification (i.e., included or excluded), and a novel per-question classification method that trains multiple classifiers for each abstract, exploiting the specific protocol (questions) of the systematic review. For the per-question method we tested four ways of combining the results of the classifiers trained for the individual questions. As evaluation measures, we calculated precision and recall for several settings of the two methods. It is most important not to exclude any relevant documents (i.e., to attain high recall for the class of interest) but also desirable to exclude most of the non-relevant documents (i.e., to attain high precision on the class of interest) in order to reduce human workload. Results: For the global method, the highest recall was 67.8{\%} and the highest precision was 37.9{\%}. For the per-question method, the highest recall was 99.2{\%}, and the highest precision was 63{\%}. The human-machine workflow proposed in this paper achieved a recall value of 99.6{\%}, and a precision value of 17.8{\%}. Conclusion: The per-question method that combines classifiers following the specific protocol of the review leads to better results than the global method in terms of recall. Because neither method is efficient enough to classify abstracts reliably by itself, the technology should be applied in a semi-automatic way, with a human expert still involved. When the workflow includes one human expert and the trained automatic classifier, recall improves to an acceptable level, showing that automatic classification techniques can reduce the human workload in the process of building a systematic review. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs)are an important component to identify and aggregate research evidence from different empirical studies. One of the activities associated with the SLR process is the selection of primary studies. The process used to select primary studies can be arduous, particularly when the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies. Aim: An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and effectiveness of graduate students in selecting primary studies manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study. Method: The same experimental design and materials of the previous experiment were used in the current experiment. Result: The previous experiment revealed that VTM techniques can speed up the selection of primary studies and increase the number of studies correctly included/excluded (effectiveness). The results of the replication confirmed that studies are more rapidly selected using VTM. We observed that the level of experience in researching has a direct relationship with the effectiveness. Conclusion: VTM techniques have proven valuable in the selection of primary studies.},

Methods: We used an open-source, data-mining suite to process and classify biomedical citations that point to mostly nonrandomized studies from 2 systematic reviews. We built training and test sets for citation portions and compared classifier performance by considering the value of indexing, various feature sets, and optimization. We conducted our experiments in 2 phases. The design of phase I with no optimization was: 4 classifiers √ó 3 feature sets √ó 3 citation portions. Classifiers included k-nearest neighbor, na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, and evolutionary support vector machine. Feature sets included bag of words, and 2- and 3-term n-grams. Citation portions included titles, titles and abstracts, and full citations with metadata. Phase II with optimization involved a subset of the classifiers, as well as features extracted from full citations, and full citations with overweighted titles. We optimized features and classifier parameters by manually setting information gain thresholds outside of a process for iterative grid optimization with 10-fold cross-validations. We independently tested models on data reserved for that purpose and statistically compared classifier performance on 2 types of feature sets. We estimated the number of citations needed to screen by reviewers during a second pass through a reduced set of citations. Results: In phase I, the evolutionary support vector machine returned the best recall for bag of words extracted from full citations; the best classifier with respect to overall performance was k-nearest neighbor. No classifier attained good enough recall for this task without optimization. In phase II, we boosted performance with optimization for evolutionary support vector machine and complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers. Generalization performance was better for the latter in the independent tests. For evolutionary support vector machine and complement na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers, the initial retrieval set was reduced by 46{\%} and 35{\%}, respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning classifiers can help identify nonrandomized studies eligible for full-text screening by systematic reviewers. Optimization can markedly improve performance of classifiers. However, generalizability varies with the classifier. The number of citations to screen during a second independent pass through the citations can be substantially reduced. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Medical researchers looking for evidence pertinent to a specific clinical question must navigate an increasingly voluminous corpus of published literature. This data deluge has motivated the development of machine learning and data mining technologies to facilitate efficient biomedical research. Despite the obvious labor-saving potential of these technologies and the concomitant academic interest therein, however, adoption of machine learning techniques by medical researchers has been relatively sluggish. One explanation for this is that while many machine learning methods have been proposed and retrospectively evaluated, they are rarely (if ever) actually made accessible to the practitioners whom they would benefit. In this work, we describe the ongoing development of an end-to-end interactive machine learning system at the Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center. More specifically, we have developed abstrackr, an online tool for the task of citation screening for systematic reviews. This tool provides an interface to our machine learning methods. The main aim of this work is to provide a case study in deploying cutting-edge machine learning methods that will actually be used by experts in a clinical research setting.},

abstract = {High quality, cost-effective medical care requires consideration of the best available, most appropriate evidence in the care of each patient, a practice known as Evidence-based Medicine (EBM). EBM is dependent upon the wide availability and coverage of accurate, objective syntheses called evidence reports (also called systematic reviews). These are compiled by a time and resourceintensive process that is largely manual, and that has not taken advantage of many of the advances in information processing technologies that have assisted other textual domains. We propose a specific text-mining based pipeline to support the creation and updating of evidence reports that provides support for the literature collection, collation, and triage steps of the systematic review process. The pipeline includes a metasearch engine that covers both bibliographic databases and selected ‚Äúgrey‚Äù literature; a module that classifies articles according to study type; a module for grouping studies that are closely related (e.g. that derive from the same underlying clinical trial or same study cohort); and an automated system that ranks publications according to the likelihood that they will meet inclusion criteria for the report. The proposed pipeline will also enable groups performing systematic review to reuse tools and models created by other groups, and will provide a test-bed for further informatics research to develop improved tools in the future. Ultimately, this should increase the rate that high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be generated, accessed and utilized by clinicians, patients, caregivers, and policymakers, resulting in better and more costeffective care.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to improve on the selection of algorithms for classifier committees applied to reducing the workload of human experts in building systematic reviews used in evidence-based medicine. We focus on clustering pre-selected classifiers based on a multi-measure prediction performance evaluation expressed in terms of a projection from a high-dimensional space to a visualizable two-dimensional one. The best classifier was selected from each cluster and included in the committee. We applied the committee of classifiers to rank biomedical abstracts based on the predicted relevance to the topic under review. We identified a subset of abstracts that represents the bottom of the ranked list (predicted as irrelevant). We used False Negatives (relevant articles mistakenly ranked at the bottom) as a final performance measure. Our early experiments demonstrate that the classifier committee built using our new approach outperformed committees of classifiers arbitrary created from the same list of pre-selected classifiers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 ACM. This paper introduces a test collection for evaluating the effectiveness of different methods used to retrieve research studies for inclusion in systematic reviews. Systematic reviews appraise and synthesise studies that meet specific inclusion criteria. Systematic reviews intended for a biomedical science audience use boolean queries with many, often complex, search clauses to retrieve studies; these are then manually screened to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. This process is expensive and time consuming. The development of systems that improve retrieval effectiveness will have an immediate impact by reducing the complexity and resources required for this process. Our test collection consists of approximately 26 million research studies extracted from the freely available MEDLINE database, 94 review (query) topics extracted from Cochrane systematic reviews, and corresponding relevance assessments. Tasks for which the collection can be used for information retrieval system evaluation are described and the use of the collection to evaluate common baselines within one such task is demonstrated. The test collection is available at https://github.com/ielab/SIGIR2017-PICO-Collection.},

abstract = {The PECO framework is a knowledge representation for formulating clinical questions. Queries are decomposed into four aspects, which are Patient-Problem (P), Exposure (E), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). However, no test collection is available to evaluate such framework in information retrieval. In this work, we first present the construction of a large test collection extracted from systematic literature reviews. We then describe an analysis of the distribution of PECO elements throughout the relevant documents and propose a language modeling approach that uses these distributions as a weighting strategy. In our experiments carried out on a collection of 1.5 million documents and 423 queries, our method was found to lead to an improvement of 28{\%} in MAP and 50{\%} in P@5, as compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {This paper provides a systematic review of previous software fault prediction studies with a specific focus on metrics, methods, and datasets. The review uses 74 software fault prediction papers in 11 journals and several conference proceedings. According to the review results, the usage percentage of public datasets increased significantly and the usage percentage of machine learning algorithms increased slightly since 2005. In addition, method-level metrics are still the most dominant metrics in fault prediction research area and machine learning algorithms are still the most popular methods for fault prediction. Researchers working on software fault prediction area should continue to use public datasets and machine learning algorithms to build better fault predictors. The usage percentage of class-level is beyond acceptable levels and they should be used much more than they are now in order to predict the faults earlier in design phase of software life cycle. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {As computing infrastructure expands, resource management in a large, heterogeneous, and distributed environment becomes a challenging task. In a cloud environment, with uncertainty and dispersion of resources, one encounters problems of allocation of resources, which is caused by things such as heterogeneity, dynamism, and failures. Unfortunately, existing resource management techniques, frameworks, and mechanisms are insufficient to handle these environments, applications, and resource behaviors. To provide efficient performance of workloads and applications, the aforementioned characteristics should be addressed effectively. This research depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of autonomic resource management in the area of the cloud in general and QoS (Quality of Service)-aware autonomic resource management specifically. The current status of autonomic resource management in cloud computing is distributed into various categories. Methodical analysis of autonomic resource management in cloud computing and its techniques are described as developed by various industry and academic groups. Further, taxonomy of autonomic resource management in the cloud has been presented. This research work will help researchers find the important characteristics of autonomic resource management and will also help to select the most suitable technique for autonomic resource management in a specific application along with significant future research directions.},

abstract = {The recent decades have witnessed an unprecedented expansion in the volume of unstructured data in digital textual formats. Companies are now starting to recognize the potential economic value lying untapped in their text data repositories and sources, including external ones, such as social media platforms, and internal ones, such as safety reports and other company-specific document collections. Information extracted from these textual data sources is valuable for a range of enterprise application and for informed decision making. In this article we provide a systematic review of the current state of the art in the application of text analytics in industry. Our review is structured along three dimensions: the application context, the methods and techniques utilized, and the evaluation procedure. Based on the review, we identify the different challenges and constraints that an real-world, industrial environment imposes on text analytics techniques, as opposed to their deployment in more controlled, research environments. In addition, we formulate a set of desiderata that text analytics techniques should satisfy in order to alleviate these challenges and to ensure their successful deployment in industry. Furthermore, we discuss future trends in text analytics and their potential application in industry.},

abstract = {Motivation: Since many important biological systems or processes are dynamic systems, it is important to study the gene expression patterns over time in a genomic scale in order to capture the dynamic behavior of gene expression. Microarray technologies have made it possible to measure the gene expression levels of essentially all the genes during a given biological process. In order to determine the transcriptional factors (TFs) involved in gene regulation during a given biological process, we propose to develop a functional response model with varying coefficients in order to model the transcriptional effects on gene expression levels and to develop a group smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regression procedure for selecting the TFs with varying coefficients that are involved in gene regulation during a biological process. Results: Simulation studies indicated that such a procedure is quite effective in selecting the relevant variables with time-varying coefficients and in estimating the coefficients. Application to the yeast cell cycle microarray time course gene expression data set identified 19 of the 21 known TFs related to the cell cycle process. In addition, we have identified another 52 TFs that also have periodic transcriptional effects on gene expression during the cell cycle process. Compared to simple linear regression (SLR) analysis at each time point, our procedure identified more known cell cycle related TFs. Conclusions: The proposed group SCAD regression procedure is very effective for identifying variables with time-varying coefficients, in particular, for identifying the TFs that are related to gene expression over time. By identifying the TFs that are related to gene expression variations over time, the procedure can potentially provide more insight into the gene regulatory networks.},

abstract = {The objective of technology-assisted review (" TAR ") is to find as much relevant information as possible with reason-able effort. Quality is a measure of the extent to which a TAR method achieves this objective, while reliability is a measure of how consistently it achieves an acceptable result. We are concerned with how to define, measure, and achieve high quality and high reliability in TAR. When quality is defined using the traditional goal-post method of specifying a minimum acceptable recall threshold, the quality and reli-ability of a TAR method are both, by definition, equal to the probability of achieving the threshold. Assuming this defini-tion of quality and reliability, we show how to augment any TAR method to achieve guaranteed reliability, for a quan-tifiable level of additional review effort. We demonstrate this result by augmenting the TAR method supplied as the baseline model implementation for the TREC 2015 Total Recall Track, measuring reliability and effort for 555 top-ics from eight test collections. While our empirical results corroborate our claim of guaranteed reliability, we observe that the augmentation strategy may entail disproportionate effort, especially when the number of relevant documents is low. To address this limitation, we propose stopping criteria for the model implementation that may be applied with no additional review effort, while achieving empirical reliability that compares favorably to the provably reliable method. We further argue that optimizing reliability according to the traditional goal-post method is inconsistent with certain subjective aspects of quality, and that optimizing a Taguchi quality loss function may be more apt.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In principle, an organism's ability to survive in a speci.c environment, is an observable result of the organism's regulatory and metabolic capabilities. Nonetheless, current knowledge about the global relation of the metabolisms and the niches of organisms is still limited. RESULTS: In order to further investigate this relation, we grouped species showing similar metabolic capabilities and systematically mapped their habitats onto these groups. For this purpose, we predicted the metabolic capabilities for 214 sequenced genomes. Based on these predictions, we grouped the genomes by hierarchical clustering. Finally, we mapped different environmental conditions and diseases related to the genomes onto the resulting clusters. This mapping uncovered several conditions and diseases that were unexpectedly enriched in clusters of metabolically similar species. As an example, Encephalitozoon cuniculi--a microsporidian causing a multisystemic disease accompanied by CNS problems in rabbits--occurred in the same metabolism-based cluster as bacteria causing similar symptoms in humans.

It affects the searcher's interaction with the IR system, his expectations and his decisions about the documents he retrieves. Therefore, knowing more about what features are important in a searcher's context and what they are used for, can help design more useful and successful IR systems. This paper has three main contributions. It starts with a literature review on the definition of context and on context taxonomies (1). A systematic representation of context features and uses, based on related work, is then proposed (2) and used in a survey on the use of context features in IR (3). This analysis has concluded that interaction context is the most used category of features and Indexing and Searching are the tasks where context features are most employed. This work, an initial phase of a PhD research, provides a systematic review of what is being done in the area and proposes a taxonomy for IR},

In spite of its relevance, the establishment of consistent categories and classification of primary studies in these categories are manually conducted. Objective: We propose an approach, named SM-VTM (Systematic Mapping based on Visual Text Mining), to support categorization and classification stages in the systematic mapping using Visual Text Mining (VTM), aiming at reducing time and effort required in this process. Method: We established SM-VTM, selected a VTM tool and conducted a case study comparing results of two systematic mappings: one performed manually and another using our approach. Results: The results of both systematic mappings were very similar, showing the viability of SM-VTM. Furthermore, since our approach was applied using a tool, reduction of time and effort can be achieved.

abstract = {The book provides a survey about the field of Qualitative Reasoning, it contrasts and classifies its approaches and puts them into a common framework. Qualitative Reasoning represents an approach of Artificial Intelligence to model dynamic systems, about which little information is available, and to derive statements about the potential behavior of these systems, putting emphasis on a causal explanation of the behavior. Both variables and relationships between variables are described by means of qualitative terms such as small and large or positive and negative. Since this approach also takes into consideration the way how humans reason about physical systems, it can be stated that Qualitative Reasoning participates in the creation of a cognitive theory of non-numerical process descriptions which can be mapped onto a digital computer. This approach can be used for simulation, diagnosis, design, structure identification and interpretation. Areas of application are physics, medicine, the field of ecology, process control, etc. In addition to the classification of existing methods, the book presents a new approach based on fuzzy sets. And the work relates Qualitative Reasoning with such fields of Expert Systems, System Theory and Cognitive Science.},

abstract = {Searching for relevant documents is a laborious task involved in preparing systematic reviews of biomedical literature. Currently, complex Boolean queries are iteratively developed, and then each document of the final query result is assessed for relevance. However, the result set sizes of these queries are hard to control, and in practice it is difficult to balance the competing desires to keep result sets to a manageable volume, and yet not exclude relevant documents from consideration. Ranking overcomes these problems by allowing the user to choose the number of documents to be inspected. However, previouswork did not show significant improvements over the Boolean approach when ranked keyword queries based on terms in the Boolean queries, review title, research question or inclusion criteria were used. The extended Boolean retrieval model also provides ranked output, but existing complex Boolean queries can be directly used as formal description of the complex information needs occurring in this domain. In this paper we show that extended Boolean retrieval is able to find a larger quantity of relevant documents than previous approaches when comparable (or greater) numbers of documents are inspected for relevance.},

abstract = {Background. Search and selection of primary studies in System-atic Literature Reviews (SLR) is labour intensive, and hard to repli-cate and update. Aims. We explore a machine learning approach to support semi-automated search and selection in SLRs to address these weaknesses. Method. We 1) train a classiier on an initial set of papers, 2) extend this set of papers by automated search and snowballing, 3) have the researcher validate the top paper, selected by the classiier, and 4) update the set of papers and iterate the process until a stopping criterion is met. Results. We demonstrate with a proof-of-concept tool that the proposed automated search and selection approach generates valid search strings and that the performance for subsets of primary studies can reduce the man-ual work by half. Conclusions. approach is promising and the demonstrated advantages include cost savings and replicability. next steps include further tool development and evaluate the approach on a complete SLR.},

abstract = {Software Analytics (SA) is a new branch of big data analytics that has recently emerged (2011). What distinguishes SA from direct software analysis is that it links data mined from many different software artifacts to obtain valuable insights. These insights are useful for the decision-making process throughout the different phases of the software lifecycle. Since SA is currently a hot and promising topic, we have conducted a systematic literature review, presented in this paper, to identify gaps in knowledge and open research areas in SA. Because many researchers are still confused about the true potential of SA, we had to filter out available research papers to obtain the most SA-relevant work for our review. This filtration yielded 19 studies out of 135. We have based our systematic review on four main factors: which software practitioners SA targets, which domains are covered by SA, which artifacts are extracted by SA, and whether these artifacts are linked or not. The results of our review have shown that much of the available SA research only serves the needs of developers. Also, much of the available research uses only one artifact which, in turn, means fewer links between artifacts and fewer insights. This shows that the available SA research work is still embryonic leaving plenty of room for future research in the SA field.},

abstract = {Context: Automated static analysis (ASA) identifies potential source code anomalies early in the software development lifecycle that could lead to field failures. Excessive alert generation and a large proportion of unimportant or incorrect alerts (unactionable alerts) may cause developers to reject the use of ASA. Techniques that identify anomalies important enough for developers to fix (actionable alerts) may increase the usefulness of ASA in practice. Objective: The goal of this work is to synthesize available research results to inform evidence-based selection of actionable alert identification techniques (AAIT). Method: Relevant studies about AAITs were gathered via a systematic literature review. Results: We selected 21 peer-reviewed studies of AAITs. The techniques use alert type selection; contextual information; data fusion; graph theory; machine learning; mathematical and statistical models; or dynamic detection to classify and prioritize actionable alerts. All of the AAITs are evaluated via an example with a variety of evaluation metrics. Conclusion: The selected studies support (with varying strength), the premise that the effective use of ASA is improved by supplementing ASA with an AAIT. Seven of the 21 selected studies reported the precision of the proposed AAITs. The two studies with the highest precision built models using the subject program's history. Precision measures how well a technique identifies true actionable alerts out of all predicted actionable alerts. Precision does not measure the number of actionable alerts missed by an AAIT or how well an AAIT identifies unactionable alerts. Inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, subject programs, and ASAs in the selected studies preclude meta-analysis and prevent the current results from informing evidence-based selection of an AAIT. We propose building on an actionable alert identification benchmark for comparison and evaluation of AAIT from literature on a standard set of subjects and utilizing a common set of evaluation metrics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Context The International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) maintains a software development repository with over 6000 software projects. This dataset makes it possible to estimate a project's size, effort, duration, and cost. Objective The aim of this study was to determine how and to what extent, ISBSG has been used by researchers from 2000, when the first papers were published, until June of 2012. Method A systematic mapping review was used as the research method, which was applied to over 129 papers obtained after the filtering process. Results The papers were published in 19 journals and 40 conferences. Thirty-five percent of the papers published between years 2000 and 2011 have received at least one citation in journals and only five papers have received six or more citations. Effort variable is the focus of 70.5{\%} of the papers, 22.5{\%} center their research in a variable different from effort and 7{\%} do not consider any target variable. Additionally, in as many as 70.5{\%} of papers, effort estimation is the research topic, followed by dataset properties (36.4{\%}). The more frequent methods are Regression (61.2{\%}), Machine Learning (35.7{\%}), and Estimation by Analogy (22.5{\%}). ISBSG is used as the only support in 55{\%} of the papers while the remaining papers use complementary datasets. The ISBSG release 10 is used most frequently with 32 references. Finally, some benefits and drawbacks of the usage of ISBSG have been highlighted. Conclusion This work presents a snapshot of the existing usage of ISBSG in software development research. ISBSG offers a wealth of information regarding practices from a wide range of organizations, applications, and development types, which constitutes its main potential. However, a data preparation process is required before any analysis. Lastly, the potential of ISBSG to develop new research is also outlined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BN) have been used for decision making in software engineering for many years. In other fields such as bioinformatics, BNs are rigorously evaluated in terms of the techniques that are used to build the network structure and to learn the parameters. We extend our prior mapping study to investigate the extent to which contextual and methodological details regarding BN construction are reported in the studies. We conduct a systematic literature review on the applications of BNs to predict software quality. We focus on more detailed questions regarding (1) dataset characteristics, (2) techniques used for parameter learning, (3) techniques used for structure learning, (4) use of tools, and (5) model validation techniques. Results on ten primary studies show that BNs are mostly built based on expert knowledge, i.e. structure and prior distributions are defined by experts, whereas authors benefit from BN tools and quantitative data to validate their models. In most of the papers, authors do not clearly explain their justification for choosing a specific technique, and they do not compare their proposed BNs with other machine learning approaches. There is also a lack of consensus on the performance measures to validate the proposed BNs. Compared to other domains, the use of BNs is still very limited and current publications do not report enough details to replicate the studies. We propose a framework that provides a set of guidelines for reporting the essential contextual and methodological details of BNs. We believe such a framework would be useful to replicate and extend the work on BNs.},

abstract = {? 2015 ACM.Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question by interpreting the current pertinent literature. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort to the group of experts. Most of proposed works apply supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to infer exclusion and inclusion rules by observing a human screener. Unless, these techniques holds very little promise in study identification phase, because the rate of excluding citations erroneously still unreasonable. In this paper, we contribute to this line of works by proposing an alternative approach, not yet tested in this domain based on semantic rule-based classifiers. This approach involved applying a novel Hybrid Feature Selection Method (HFSM) within a Class Association Rules (CARs) algorithm. Experiments are conducted on a corpus resulting from an actual systematic review. The obtained results show that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature.},

abstract = {Stemming is a program that matches the morphological variants of the word to its root word. Stemming is extensively used as a pre-processing tool in the field of natural language processing, information retrieval, and language modeling. Though a lot of advancements have been made in the field, yet organized arrangement of the previous work and efforts are lacking in this field. In this paper, we present a review of the text stemming theory, algorithms, and applications. It first describes the existing literature relevant to text stemming by classifying it according to certain key parameters; then it describes the deep analysis of some well-known stemming algorithms on standard data sets. In the end, the current state-of-the-art and certain open issues related to unsupervised stemming are presented. The main aim of this paper is to provide an extensive and useful understanding of the important aspects of text stemming. The open issues and analysis of the current stemming techniques will help the researchers to think of new lines to conduct research in future.},

abstract = {Cross domain recommender systems (CDRS) can assist recommendations in a target domain based on knowledge learned from a source domain. CDRS consists of three building blocks: domain, user-item overlap scenarios, and recommendation tasks. The objective of this research is to identify the most widely used CDRS building-block definitions, identify common features between them, classify current research in the frame of identified definitions, group together research with respect to algorithm types, present existing problems, and recommend future directions for CDRS research. To achieve this objective, we have conducted a systematic literature review of 94 shortlisted studies. We classified the selected studies using the tag-based approach and designed classification grids. Using classification grids, it was found that the category-domain contributed a maximum of 62{\%}, whereas the time domain contributed at least 3{\%}. User-item overlaps were found to have equal contribution. Single target domain recommendation task was found at a maximum of 78{\%}, whereas cross-domain recommendation task had a minor influence at only 10{\%}. MovieLens contributed the most at 22{\%}, whereas Yahoo-music provided 1{\%} between 29 datasets. Factorization-based algorithms contributed a total of 37{\%}, whereas semantics-based algorithms contributed 6{\%} among seven types of identified algorithm groups. Finally, future directions were grouped into five categories.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews underpin Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) by addressing precise clinical questions via comprehensive synthesis of all relevant published evidence. Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations.},

abstract = {Sign language recognition, SLR, using spatial positions and arrangements of the hands over time is a challenging multi-variable time series recognition problem with several potential applications. Here we explore, for SLR purposes, a hierarchically connected network of nodes based on a Bayesian-like paradigm known as hierarchical temporal memory, HTM, that models neocortical principles of organization and information coding. HTM is a broad paradigm for pattern recognition, control, attention and forward prediction that exploits the hierarchy in time and space existing in the physical world during both learning and inference. In this work we focus on HTM capabilities for pattern recognition. We extend the traditional HTM paradigm with an original top node in order to improve HTMs performance in problems where instances unfold over time. The extended top node stores and compares sequences of spatio-temporally codified inputs to handle the temporal evolution of instances in sign language. Sequence comparison is carried out using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment that employs dynamic programming. We compare the performance of the extended HTM with traditional HTMs and machine learning algorithms routinely used in the literature for SLR. The extended HTM improves performance of traditional HTM for SLR, reaching 91{\%} recognition accuracy for a data set of 95 categories of Australian sign language. When sufficient training instances are available, the extended HTM matches or outperforms state of the art methods for SLR such as Hidden Markov Models or Metafeatures T-Classes without the usage of a language model, nor pre-processing of sensor data. The extended HTM employs relatively small feature vectors in comparison to methods in the literature. Our method learns the spatio-temporal data structures and transitions that occur in the data without depending on manually predefined features to be searched for and works well in real time. These results suggest that the extended HTM approach is a valid bioinspired alternative to existing SLR engines and that it can be successfully applied to other machine learning tasks whose input instances also unfold over time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Multi-label learning handles datasets where each instance is associated with multiple labels, which are often correlated. As other machine learning tasks, multi-label learning also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which can be mitigated by dimensionality reduction tasks, such as feature selection. The standard approach for multi-label feature selection transforms the multi-label dataset into single-label datasets before using traditional feature selection algorithms. However, this approach often ignores label dependence. This work proposes an alternative method, LCFS, which constructs new labels based on relations between the original labels to augment the label set of the original dataset. Afterwards, the augmented dataset is submitted to the standard multi-label feature selection approach. Experiments using Information Gain as a measure to evaluate features were carried out in 10 multi-label benchmark datasets. For each dataset, the quality of the features selected was assessed by the quality of the classifiers built using the features selected by the standard approach in the original dataset, as well as in the dataset constructed by four LCFS settings. The results show that setting LCFS with simple strategies using pairs of labels gives rise to better classifiers than the ones built using the standard approach in the original dataset.

abstract = {The need to overcome the weaknesses of single estimation techniques for prediction tasks has given rise to ensemble methods in software development effort estimation (SDEE). An ensemble effort estimation (EEE) technique combines several of the single/classical models found in the SDEE literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has yet been performed with a focus on the use of EEE techniques in SDEE. The purpose of this review is to analyze EEE techniques from six viewpoints: single models used to construct ensembles, ensemble estimation accuracy, rules used to combine single estimates, accuracy comparison of EEE techniques with single models, accuracy comparison between EEE techniques and methodologies used to construct ensemble methods. We performed a systematic review of EEE studies published between 2000 and 2016, and we selected 24 of them to address the questions raised in this review. We found that EEE techniques may be separated into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous, and that the machine learning single models are the most frequently employed in constructing EEE techniques. We also found that EEE techniques usually yield acceptable estimation accuracy, and in fact are more accurate than single models.},

abstract = {The quality of the interpretation of the sentiment in the online buzz in the social media and the online news can determine the predictability of financial markets and cause huge gains or losses. That is why a number of researchers have turned their full attention to the different aspects of this problem lately. However, there is no well-rounded theoretical and technical framework for approaching the problem to the best of our knowledge. We believe the existing lack of such clarity on the topic is due to its interdisciplinary nature that involves at its core both behavioral-economic topics as well as artificial intelligence. We dive deeper into the interdisciplinary nature and contribute to the formation of a clear frame of discussion. We review the related works that are about market prediction based on online-text-mining and produce a picture of the generic components that they all have. We, furthermore, compare each system with the rest and identify their main differentiating factors. Our comparative analysis of the systems expands onto the theoretical and technical foundations behind each. This work should help the research community to structure this emerging field and identify the exact aspects which require further research and are of special significance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Karystianis2017a,
abstract = {Introduction Most data extraction efforts in epidemiology are focused on obtaining targeted information from clinical trials. In contrast, limited research has been conducted on the identification of information from observational studies, a major source for human evidence in many fields, including environmental health. The recognition of key epidemiological information (e.g., exposures) through text mining techniques can assist in the automation of systematic reviews and other evidence summaries. Method We designed and applied a knowledge-driven, rule-based approach to identify targeted information (study design, participant population, exposure, outcome, confounding factors, and the country where the study was conducted) from abstracts of epidemiological studies included in several systematic reviews of environmental health exposures. The rules were based on common syntactical patterns observed in text and are thus not specific to any systematic review. To validate the general applicability of our approach, we compared the data extracted using our approach versus hand curation for 35 epidemiological study abstracts manually selected for inclusion in two systematic reviews. Results The returned F-score, precision, and recall ranged from 70{\%} to 98{\%}, 81{\%} to 100{\%}, and 54{\%} to 97{\%}, respectively. The highest precision was observed for exposure, outcome and population (100{\%}) while recall was best for exposure and study design with 97{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively. The lowest recall was observed for the population (54{\%}), which also had the lowest F-score (70{\%}). Conclusion The generated performance of our text-mining approach demonstrated encouraging results for the identification of targeted information from observational epidemiological study abstracts related to environmental exposures. We have demonstrated that rules based on generic syntactic patterns in one corpus can be applied to other observational study design by simple interchanging the dictionaries aiming to identify certain characteristics (i.e., outcomes, exposures). At the document level, the recognised information can assist in the selection and categorization of studies included in a systematic review.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein‚àíprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Software maintenance starts as early as the first artifacts are delivered. Despite keeping maintenance activities on track is a high cost activity, it is mandatory for the software project success. In this effect, Change Request (CR) repositories are fundamental in softwaremaintenance. They facilitate the management of CRs, as well as they are the central point where stakeholders coordinate activities and communicate. However, the benefits of CR repositories do not come without burdens, and commonly occurring issues should be handled, such as: duplicate CRs; large amounts of CRs that must be assigned; or poorly described CRs. These characteristics led to an increasing interest in the investigation of CR repositories considering different aspects of software development and CR management. Thus, we performed a systematic mapping study to characterize this investigation.We considered 142 studies, which we classified in two ways. First, we classified the studies in different topics, which in turn were grouped into two categories: challenges and opportunities. Second, we provided a classification for the challenge topics built upon an existing taxonomy for Information Retrieval models. In addition, we investigated tools and services for CRs management, to understand if they addressed the identified topics, and how they do it.},

@article{Casteleyn2014a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND. The term Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) is generally associated with Web applications that provide the features and functionality of traditional desktop applications. Ten years after the introduction of the term, an ample amount of research has been carried out to study various aspects of RIAs. It has thus become essential to summarize this research and provide an adequate overview. OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study is to assemble, classify, and analyze all RIA research performed in the scientific community, thus providing a consolidated overview thereof, and to identify well-established topics, trends, and open research issues. Additionally, we provide a qualitative discussion of the most interesting findings. This work therefore serves as a reference work for beginning and established RIA researchers alike, as well as for industrial actors that need an introduction in the field, or seek pointers to (a specific subset of) the state-of-the-art. METHOD. A systematic mapping study is performed in order to identify all RIA-related publications, define a classification scheme, and categorize, analyze, and discuss the identified research according to it. RESULTS. Our source identification phase resulted in 133 relevant, peer-reviewed publications, published between 2002 and 2011 in a wide variety of venues. They were subsequently classified according to four facets: development activity, research topic, contribution type, and research type. Pie, stacked bar, and bubble charts were used to depict and analyze the results. A deeper analysis is provided for the most interesting and/or remarkable results. CONCLUSION. Analysis of the results shows that, although the RIA term was coined in 2002, the first RIA-related research appeared in 2004. From 2007 there was a significant increase in research activity, peaking in 2009 and decreasing to pre-2009 levels afterwards. All development phases are covered in the identified research, with emphasis on ‚Äúdesign‚Äù (33{\%}) and ‚Äúimplementation‚Äù (29{\%}). The majority of research proposes a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù (44{\%}), followed by ‚Äúmodel‚Äù (22{\%}), ‚Äúmethodology‚Äù (18{\%}), and ‚Äútools‚Äù (16{\%}); no publications in the category ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù were found. The preponderant research topic is ‚Äúmodels, methods and methodologies‚Äù (23{\%}) and, to a lesser extent, ‚Äúusability and accessibility‚Äù and ‚Äúuser interface‚Äù (11{\%} each). On the other hand, the topic ‚Äúlocalization, internationalization and multilinguality‚Äù received no attention at all, and topics such as ‚Äúdeep Web‚Äù (under 1{\%}), ‚Äúbusiness processing‚Äù, ‚Äúusage analysis‚Äù, ‚Äúdata management‚Äù, ‚Äúquality and metrics‚Äù (all under 2{\%}), ‚Äúsemantics‚Äù, and ‚Äúperformance‚Äù (slightly above 2{\%}) received very little attention. Finally, there is a large majority of ‚Äúsolution proposals‚Äù (66{\%}), few ‚Äúevaluation research‚Äù (14{\%}), and even fewer ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù (6{\%}), although the latter have been increasing in recent years.},

abstract = {Search engines became a de facto place to start information acquisition on the Web. Though due to web spam phe- nomenon, search results are not always as good as desired. Moreover, spam evolves that makes the problem of provid- ing high quality search even more challenging. Over the last decade research on adversarial information retrieval has gained a lot of interest both from academia and industry. In this paper we present a systematic review of web spam de- tection techniques with the focus on algorithms and under- lying principles. We categorize all existing algorithms into three categories based on the type of information they use: content-based methods, link-based methods, and methods based on non-traditional data such as user behaviour, clicks, HTTP sessions. In turn, we perform a subcategorization of link-based category into Ô¨Åve groups based on ideas and prin- ciples used: labels propagation, link pruning and reweight- ing, labels reÔ¨Ånement, graph regularization, and feature- based. We also deÔ¨Åne the concept of web spam numerically and provide a brief survey on various spam forms. Finally, we summarize the observations and underlying principles applied for web spam detection.},

abstract = {Identifying features and their relations (i.e., variation points) is crucial in the process of migrating single software systems to software product lines (SPL). Various approaches have been proposed to perform feature extraction automatically from different artifacts, for instance, feature location in legacy code. Usually such approaches a) omit variability information and b) rely on artifacts that reside in advanced phases of the development process, thus, being only of limited usefulness in the context of SPLs. In contrast, feature and variability extraction from natural language (NL) documents is more favorable, because a mapping to several other artifacts is usually established from the very beginning. In this paper, we provide a multi-dimensional overview of approaches for feature and variability extraction from NL documents by means of a systematic literature review (SLR). We selected 25 primary studies and carefully evaluated them regarding different aspects such as techniques used, tool support, or accuracy of the results. In a nutshell, our key insights are that i) standard NLP techniques are commonly used, ii) post-processing often includes clustering {\&} machine learning algorithms, iii) only in rare cases, the approaches support variability extraction, iv) tool support, apart from text pre-processing is often not available, and v) many approaches lack a comprehensive evaluation. Based on these observations, we derive future challenges, arguing that more effort need to be invested for making such approaches applicable in practice.},

abstract = {Background: Since the introduction of the systematic review process to Software Engineering in 2004, researchers have investigated a number of ways to mitigate the amount of effort and time taken to filter through large volumes of literature. Aim: This study aims to provide a critical analysis of text mining techniques used to support the citation screening stage of the systematic review process. Method: We critically re-reviewed papers included in a previous systematic review which addressed the use of text mining methods to support the screening of papers for inclusion in a review. The previous review did not provide a detailed analysis of the text mining methods used. We focus on the availability in the papers of information about the text mining methods employed, including the description and explanation of the methods, parameter settings, assessment of the appropriateness of their application given the size and dimensionality of the data used, performance on training, testing and validation data sets, and further information that may support the reproducibility of the included studies. Results: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB) and Committee of classifiers (Ensemble) are the most used classification algorithms. In all of the studies, features were represented with Bag-of-Words (BOW) using both binary features (28{\%}) and term frequency (66{\%}). Five studies experimented with n-grams with n between 2 and 4, but mostly the unigram was used. $\chi$2, information gain and tf-idf were the most commonly used feature selection techniques. Feature extraction was rarely used although LDA and topic modelling were used. Recall, precision, F and AUC were the most used metrics and cross validation was also well used. More than half of the studies used a corpus size of below 1,000 documents for their experiments while corpus size for around 80{\%} of the studies was 3,000 or fewer documents. The major common ground we found for comparing performance assessment based on independent replication of studies was the use of the same dataset but a sound performance comparison could not be established because the studies had little else in common. In most of the studies, insufficient information was reported to enable independent replication. The studies analysed generally did not include any discussion of the statistical appropriateness of the text mining method that they applied. In the case of applications of SVM, none of the studies report the number of support vectors that they found to indicate the complexity of the prediction engine that they use, making it impossible to judge the extent to which over-fitting might account for the good performance results. Conclusions: There is yet to be concrete evidence about the effectiveness of text mining algorithms regarding their use in the automation of citation screening in systematic reviews. The studies indicate that options are still being explored, but there is a need for better reporting as well as more explicit process details and access to datasets to facilitate study replication for evidence strengthening. In general, the reader often gets the impression that text mining algorithms were applied as magic tools in the reviewed papers, relying on default settings or default optimization of available machine learning toolboxes without an in-depth understanding of the statistical validity and appropriateness of such tools for text mining purposes.},

abstract = {Context: Software effort estimation is one of the most important activities in the software development process. Unfortunately, estimates are often substantially wrong. Numerous estimation methods have been proposed including Case-based Reasoning (CBR). In order to improve CBR estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed feature weighting techniques (FWT). Objective: Our purpose is to systematically review the empirical evidence to determine whether FWT leads to improved predictions. In addition we evaluate these techniques from the perspectives of (i) approach (ii) strengths and weaknesses (iii) performance and (iv) experimental evaluation approach including the data sets used. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of published, refereed primary studies on FWT (2000--2014). Results: We identified 19 relevant primary studies. These reported a range of different techniques. 17 out of 19 make benchmark comparisons with standard CBR and 16 out of 17 studies report improved accuracy. Using a one-sample sign test this positive impact is significant (p = 0.0003). Conclusion: The actionable conclusion from this study is that our review of all relevant empirical evidence supports the use of FWTs and we recommend that researchers and practitioners give serious consideration to their adoption.},

abstract = {Abstract Requirements for implemented system can be extracted and reused for a production of a new similar system. Extraction of common and variable features from requirements leverages the benefits of the software product lines engineering (SPLE). Although various approaches have been proposed in feature extractions from natural language (NL) requirements, no related literature review has been published to date for this topic. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of the state-of-the-art approaches in feature extractions from NL requirements for reuse in SPLE. We have included 13 studies in our synthesis of evidence and the results showed that hybrid natural language processing approaches were found to be in common for overall feature extraction process. A mixture of automated and semi-automated feature clustering approaches from data mining and information retrieval were also used to group common features, with only some approaches coming with support tools. However, most of the support tools proposed in the selected studies were not made available publicly and thus making it hard for practitioners' adoption. As for the evaluation, this SLR reveals that not all studies employed software metrics as ways to validate experiments and case studies. Finally, the quality assessment conducted confirms that practitioners' guidelines were absent in the selected studies.},

abstract = {Sequential pattern matching and retrieving is of real value. For example, finding stocks in the NASDAQ market whose closing prices are always about {\$}\beta‚ÇÄ higher than or \beta‚ÇÅ times as that of a given company. The probelm reduces to linear pattern retrieval: given query X, find all sequence Y from database S so that Y = \beta‚ÇÄ + \beta‚ÇÅ with confidence C. In this paper, we novelly introduce SLR (Simple Linear Regression) model [5,7] to solve this problem. We extend 1-dimensional R{\^{}}2 to ER{\^{}}2 for multi-dimensional sequence matching, such as on-line handwritten signature. In addition, we develop SLR+FFT pruning techniques based on SLR to speed up retrieval without incurring any false dismissal. Experimental results show that the pruning ratio of SLR+FFT is efficient (can be above 99{\%}). Experiments on real stocks discovered many interesting patterns. Preliminary test on on-line signature recognition using ER{\^{}}2 as similarity measure also shows high accuracy.},

abstract = {Software systems have become increasingly complex, and they are often formed by integrating independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems referenced as System of Systems (SoS). The System of Systems Integration (SoSI) emerges as a new challenge and aims to create a new feature by integrating constituent systems that contribute to the overall goal of the SoS. Often the constituent systems tend to be from different sources and behaviors and, as such, tend to employ different terminology and concepts. Also, when SoSI involves the integration of legacy systems, cases where the documentation and the necessary skills for the harmonious integration are readily available are very rare. However, it is observed that there is a lack of studies that are comprehensive and, at the same time, contain a detailed view of how the constituent systems are integrated in order to collectively achieve a common goal. Based on this scenario, the main contribution of this systematic review (SR) is to investigate the state of the art of SoSI and the software engineering methods that assist in the integration between constituent systems of a SoS. The SR has found 1398 studies and, at the end of the selection process, we selected 29 studies for data extraction. Most studies describe individuals and teams who have worked in isolation to develop solutions to certain problems without widespread adoption of a form of integration. Thus, there is a growing concern of researchers in the SoS context. However, it still lacks research and greater dissemination of concepts among researchers in the field.},

abstract = {Current heterogeneous meta-computing systems, such as computational clusters and grids offer a low cost alternative to supercomputers. In addition they are highly scalable and flexible. They consist of a host of diverse computational devices which collaborate via a high speed network and may execute high-performance applications. Many high-performance applications are an aggregate of modules. Efficient scheduling of such applications on meta-computing systems is critical to meeting deadlines. In this dissertation, we introduce three new algorithms, the Heterogeneous Critical Node First (HCNF) algorithm, the Heterogeneous Largest Task First (HLTF) algorithm and the Earliest Finish Time with Dispatch Time (EFT-DT) algorithm. HCNF is used to schedule parallel applications of forms represented by directed acyclic graphs onto networks of workstations to minimize their finish times. We compared the performance of HCNF with those of the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) and Scalable Task Duplication based Scheduling (STDS) algorithms. In terms of Schedule Length Ratio (SLR) and speedup, HCNF outperformed HEFT on average by 13{\%} and 18{\%} respectively. HCNF outperformed STDS in terms of SLR and speedup on an average by 8{\%} and 12{\%} respectively. The HLTF algorithm is used to schedule a set of independent tasks onto a network of heterogeneous processors to minimize finish time. We compared the performance of HLTF with that of the Sufferage algorithm. In terms of makespan, HLTF outperformed Sufferage on average by 4.5 {\%}, with a tenth run-time. The EFT-DT algorithm schedules a set of independent tasks onto a network of heterogeneous processors to minimize finish time when considering dispatch times of tasks. We compared the performance of EFT-DT with that of a First in First out (FIFO) schedule. In terms of minimizing makespan, on average EFT-DT outperformed FIFO by 30{\%}.},

abstract = {Background: Software fault prediction is the process of developing models that can be used by the software practitioners in the early phases of software development life cycle for detecting faulty constructs such as modules or classes. There are various machine learning techniques used in the past for predicting faults. Method: In this study we perform a systematic review of studies from January 1991 to October 2013 in the literature that use the machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. We assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. We also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. Further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. Results: In this paper we have identified 64 primary studies and seven categories of the machine learning techniques. The results prove the prediction capability of the machine learning techniques for classifying module/class as fault prone or not fault prone. The models using the machine learning techniques for estimating software fault proneness outperform the traditional statistical models. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability for predicting software fault proneness and can be used by software practitioners and researchers. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in software fault prediction is still limited and more number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work.},

abstract = {‚ÄîTo uncover interesting and actionable information from natural language documents authored by software develop-ers, many researchers rely on " out-of-the-box " NLP libraries. However, software artifacts written in natural language are different from other textual documents due to the technical language used. In this paper, we first analyze the state of the art through a systematic literature review in which we find that only a s‚Ä∫mall minority of papers justify their choice of an NLP library. We then report on a series of experiments in which we applied four state-of-the-art NLP libraries to publicly available software artifacts from three different sources. Our results show low agreement between different libraries (only between 60{\%} and 71{\%} of tokens were assigned the same part-of-speech tag by all four libraries) as well as differences in accuracy depending on source: For example, spaCy achieved the best accuracy on Stack Overflow data with nearly 90{\%} of tokens tagged correctly, while it was clearly outperformed by Google's SyntaxNet when parsing GitHub ReadMe files. Our work implies that researchers should make an informed decision about the particular NLP library they choose and that customizations to libraries might be necessary to achieve good results when analyzing software artifacts written in natural language.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews are essential for evaluating biomedical treatment options, but the growing size and complexity of the available biomedical literature combined with the rigor of the systematic review method mean that systematic reviews are extremely difficult and laborintensive to perform. In this article, I propose a method of searching the literature by systematically mining the various types of citation relationships between articles. I then test the method by comparing its precision and recall to that of 14 published systematic reviews. The method successfully retrieved 74{\%} of the studies included in these reviews and 90{\%} of the studies it could reasonably be expected to retrieve. The method also retrieved fewer than half of the total number of publications retrieved by these reviews and can be performed in substantially less time. This suggests that the proposed method offers a promising complement to traditional text-based methods of literature identification and retrieval for systematic reviews.},

abstract = {With the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, an increasing number of decision-making tasks are delegated to software systems. A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today's increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated.},

abstract = {The recognition of names and their associated categories within unstructured text traditionally relies on semantic lexicons and gazetteers. The amount of effort required to assemble large lexicons confines the recognition to either a limited domain (e.g., medical imaging), or a small set of predefined, broader categories of interest (e.g., persons, countries, organizations, products). This constitutes a serious limitation in an information seeking context. In this case, the categories of potential interest to users are more diverse (universities, agencies, retailers, celebrities), often refined (e.g., SLR digital cameras, programming languages, multinational oil companies), and usually overlapping (e.g., the same entity may be concurrently a brand name, a technology company, and an industry leader). We present a lightlysupervised method for acquiring named entities in arbitrary categories. The method applies lightweight lexico-syntactic extraction patterns to the unstructured text of Web documents. The method is a departure from traditional approaches to named entity recognition in that: 1) it does not require any start-up seed names or training; 2) it does not encode any domain knowledge in its extraction patterns; 3) it is only lightly supervised, and data-driven; 4) it does not impose any a-priori restriction on the categories of extracted names. We illustrate applications of the method in Web search, and describe experiments on 500 million Web documents and news articles.},

abstract = {The lenses of modern single lens reflex (SLR) cameras may contain a dozen or more individual lens elements to correct aberrations. With processing power more readily available, the modern trend in computational photography is to develop techniques for simple lens aberration correction in post-processing. We propose a similar approach to remove aberrations from images captured by a single imaging Fresnel lens. The image is restored using three-stage deblurring of the base color channel, sharpening other and then applying color correction. The first two steps are based on the combination of restoration techniques used for restoring images obtained from simple refraction lenses. Color correction stage is necessary to remove strong color shift caused by chromatic aberrations of simple Fresnel lens. This technique was tested on real images captured by a simple lens, which was made as a three-step approximation of the Fresnel lens. Promising results open up new opportunities in using lightw eight Fresnel lenses in miniature computer vision devices.},

abstract = {The identification of genes that influence the risk of common, complex disease primarily through interactions with other genes and environmental factors remains a statistical and computational challenge in genetic epidemiology. This challenge is partly due to the limitations of parametric statistical methods for detecting genetic effects that are dependent solely or partially on interactions. We have previously introduced a genetic programming neural network (GPNN) as a method for optimizing the architecture of a neural network to improve the identification of genetic and gene-environment combinations associated with disease risk. Previous empirical studies suggest GPNN has excellent power for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. The goal of this study was to compare the power of GPNN to stepwise logistic regression (SLR) and classification and regression trees (CART) for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. SLR and CART are standard methods of analysis for genetic association studies. Using simulated data, we show that GPNN has higher power to identify gene-gene and gene-environment interactions than SLR and CART. These results indicate that GPNN may be a useful pattern recognition approach for detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in studies of human disease. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, a vision-based medium vocabulary Chinese sign language recognition (SLR) system is presented. The proposed recognition system consists of two modules. In the first module, techniques of robust hands detection, background subtraction and pupils detection are efficiently combined to precisely extract the feature information with the aid of simple colored gloves in the unconstrained environment. Meanwhile, an effective and efficient hierarchical feature description scheme with different scale features to characterize sign language is proposed, where principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to characterize the finger features more elaborately. In the second part, a Tied-Mixture Density Hidden Markov Models (TMDHMM) framework for SLR is proposed, which can speed up the recognition without the significant loss of recognition accuracy compared with the continuous hidden Markov models (CHMM). Experimental results based on 439 frequently used Chinese sign language (CSL) words show that the proposed methods can work well for the medium vocabulary SLR in the environment without special constraints and the recognition accuracy is up to 92.5{\%}.

This paper presents a fault sampling method where a summary of a few, easily available metrics is used together with the results of a few sampled classes to generalize the fault content to an entire system. The method is tested on a large software system written in Java, that currently consists of around 2000 classes and 300,000 lines of code. The evaluation shows that the fault generalization method is good at predicting fault-prone clusters and that it is possible to generalize the values of a few representative classes.},

In this paper, I propose a method of ranking the relevance of citation-based search results to a set of key, or seed, papers by measuring the number of citation relationships they share with those key papers. I tested the method against 23 published systematic reviews and found that the method retrieved 87{\%} of the studies included in these reviews. The relevance ranking approach identified a subset of the citation search results that comprised 27{\%} of the total documents retrieved by the method, and 7{\%} of the documents retrieved by these reviews, but that contained 75{\%} of the studies included in these reviews. Additional testing suggested that the method may be less appropriate for reviews that combine literature in ways that are not reflected in the literature itself. These results suggest that this ranking method could be useful in a range of information retrieval contexts.},

For domains where dictionaries are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing, followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to extend the annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation domain. The reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies makes it a perfect domain to test on. We show the utility of DASyR through experimental results for different parameter values for the bootstrap procedure, evaluated in terms of annotator agreement, error rate, precision and recall.},

In this research, we propose to leverage advanced analytics techniques for automatically classifying articles for inclusion and exclusion for systematic review update. Specifically, we used the soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier and examined various techniques to resolve class imbalance issues. Through an empirical study, we demonstrated that the soft-margin SVM works better than the perceptron algorithm used in current research and the performance of the classifier can be further improved by exploiting different sampling methods to resolve class imbalance issues.},

abstract = {Objective: To automatically detect duplicate citations in a bibliographical database. Background: Citations retrieved from multiple search databases have different forms making manual and automatic detection of duplicates difficult. Existing methods rely on fuzzy-similarity measures which are error-prone. Methods: We analysed four pairs of original search results from MEDLINE and EMBASE that were used to create systematic reviews. An automatic tool deduplicated citations by first enriching citations with Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), and/or other unique identifiers. Duplication of records was then determined by comparing these unique identifiers. We compared our method with the duplicate detection function of a popular citation management desktop application in several configurations. Results: Citation Enrichment identified 93 {\%} (range 86 {\%}‚Äì100 {\%}) of the duplicates indexed online and erroneously marked 3 {\%} (range 0 {\%}‚Äì6 {\%}) documents as duplicates. The citation management application found 68 {\%} (range 64 {\%}‚Äì72 {\%}) without error using default setting. When set for highest deduplication, the citation management application found 94 {\%} of duplicates (range 77 {\%}‚Äì100 {\%}) and 4 {\%} error (range 0 {\%}‚Äì8 {\%}). Conclusion: Citation enrichment using unique identifiers enhances automatic deduplication. On its own, the approach seems slightly superior to tools that compare citations without enrichment. Methods that combine citation enrichment with existing fuzzy-matching may substantially reduce resource requirements of evidence synthesis.},

@article{Bui2016141,
abstract = {Objectives: Data extraction from original study reports is a time-consuming, error-prone process in systematic review development. Information extraction (IE) systems have the potential to assist humans in the extraction task, however majority of IE systems were not designed to work on Portable Document Format (PDF) document, an important and common extraction source for systematic review. In a PDF document, narrative content is often mixed with publication metadata or semi-structured text, which add challenges to the underlining natural language processing algorithm. Our goal is to categorize PDF texts for strategic use by IE systems. Methods: We used an open-source tool to extract raw texts from a PDF document and developed a text classification algorithm that follows a multi-pass sieve framework to automatically classify PDF text snippets (for brevity, texts) into TITLE, ABSTRACT, BODYTEXT, SEMISTRUCTURE, and METADATA categories. To validate the algorithm, we developed a gold standard of PDF reports that were included in the development of previous systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration. In a two-step procedure, we evaluated (1) classification performance, and compared it with machine learning classifier, and (2) the effects of the algorithm on an IE system that extracts clinical outcome mentions. Results: The multi-pass sieve algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.6{\%}, which was 9.7{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) higher than the best performing machine learning classifier that used a logistic regression algorithm. F-measure improvements were observed in the classification of TITLE (+15.6{\%}), ABSTRACT (+54.2{\%}), BODYTEXT (+3.7{\%}), SEMISTRUCTURE (+34{\%}), and MEDADATA (+14.2{\%}). In addition, use of the algorithm to filter semi-structured texts and publication metadata improved performance of the outcome extraction system (F-measure +4.1{\%}, p = 0.002). It also reduced of number of sentences to be processed by 44.9{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001), which corresponds to a processing time reduction of 50{\%} (p = 0.005). Conclusions: The rule-based multi-pass sieve framework can be used effectively in categorizing texts extracted from PDF documents. Text classification is an important prerequisite step to leverage information extraction from PDF documents.},

abstract = {While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have focused on discovering genetic loci mapped to a disease, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies combine microarray data and provide a powerful approach. Microarrays allow one to measure thousands of gene expressions simultaneously and the advances in eQTL studies enable one to capture the insight of the genetic architecture of gene expression. A number of multivariate methods have been recently proposed to identify genetic loci which are linked to gene expression taking into account joint effects and relationships between the units rather than the single locus alone independently. However, the previous research has limitations, such as the lack of supporting the cis/tran-eQTL model into being accepted as a general genetics model. We propose a novel regularized eQTL association mapping detection (Reg-AMADE) method. We have focused on the following three problems. First, we need to take into account co-expressed genes without using clustering or partitioning techniques, as well as detecting linkage disequilibrium and the joint effect of multiple genetic markers. Secondly, we need to build a regularized model to support the cis- and trans-eQTL model observed in most association studies. Lastly, we need to discover the significant genes underlying within diseases rather than a common component. We also propose a new simulation experiment method that implements practical situations so that the results can be evaluated in the true sense instead of the assessment with random samples generated from multivariate normal distributions that most research has mainly used. The power to detect both the joint effect and grouping effect of SNPs and gene expressions is assessed in the simulation study.},

abstract = {The need to overcome the weaknesses of single estimation techniques for prediction tasks has given rise to ensemble methods in software development effort estimation (SDEE). An ensemble effort estimation (EEE) technique combines several of the single/classical models found in the SDEE literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has yet been performed with a focus on the use of EEE techniques in SDEE. The purpose of this review is to analyze EEE techniques from six viewpoints: single models used to construct ensembles, ensemble estimation accuracy, rules used to combine single estimates, accuracy comparison of EEE techniques with single models, accuracy comparison between EEE techniques and methodologies used to construct ensemble methods. We performed a systematic review of EEE studies published between 2000 and 2016, and we selected 24 of them to address the questions raised in this review. We found that EEE techniques may be separated into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous, and that the machine learning single models are the most frequently employed in constructing EEE techniques. We also found that EEE techniques usually yield acceptable estimation accuracy, and in fact are more accurate than single models.},

abstract = {As one of the important research areas of multimodal interaction, sign language recognition (SLR) has attracted increasing interest. In SLR, especially on medium or large vocabulary, it is usually difficult or impractical to collect enough training data. Thus, how to improve the recognition on the limited training samples is a significant issue. In this paper, a simple but effective hierarchical voting classification (HVC) scheme for improving visual SLR, which makes efficient use of limited training data, is proposed. The key idea of HVC scheme is similar to but not the same as Bagging technique. Firstly, it constructs several training sets from the original training set in a combinatorial fashion to generate the corresponding continuous hidden Markov models (CHMM) ensemble. Then, it determines the ensemble output by appropriate local voting strategy. Finally, it obtains the final recognition result by the global voting. Experimental results show that the HVC scheme outperforms the conventional single CHMM approach in terms of recognition accuracy on the limited training data. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 ACM.},

abstract = {Background:: Statistical validity and model complexity are both important concepts to enhanced understanding and correctness assessment of computational models. However, information about these are often missing from publications applying machine learning. Aim: The aim of this study is to show the importance of providing details that can indicate statistical validity and complexity of models in publications. This is explored in the context of citation screening automation using machine learning techniques. Method: We built 15 Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, each developed using word2vec (average word) features --- and data for 15 review topics from the Drug Evaluation Review Program (DERP) of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Results: The word2vec features were found to be sufficiently linearly separable by the SVM and consequently we used the linear kernels. In 11 of the 15 models, the negative (majority) class used over 80{\%} of its training data as support vectors (SVs) and approximately 45{\%} of the positive training data. Conclusions: In this context, exploring the SVs revealed that the models are overly complex against ideal expectations of not more than 2{\%}-5{\%} (and preferably much less) of the training vectors.},

In order to facilitate better usage of emails and explore business potentials in emailing, various data mining techniques have been applied on email data. In this paper, we present a brief survey of the major research efforts on email mining. To emphasize the differences between email mining and general text mining, we organize our survey on five major email mining tasks, namely spam detection, email categorization, contact analysis, email network property analysis and email visualization. Those tasks are inherently incorporated into various usages of emails. We systematically review the commonly used techniques and also discuss the related software tools available.},

abstract = {Objective: The amount of information for clinicians and clinical researchers is growing exponentially. Text summarization reduces information as an attempt to enable users to find and understand relevant source texts more quickly and effortlessly. In recent years, substantial research has been conducted to develop and evaluate various summarization techniques in the biomedical domain. The goal of this study was to systematically review recent published research on summarization of textual documents in the biomedical domain. Materials and methods: MEDLINE (2000 to October 2013), IEEE Digital Library, and the ACM digital library were searched. Investigators independently screened and abstracted studies that examined text summarization techniques in the biomedical domain. Information is derived from selected articles on five dimensions: input, purpose, output, method and evaluation. Results: Of 10,786 studies retrieved, 34 (0.3{\%}) met the inclusion criteria. Natural language processing (17; 50{\%}) and a hybrid technique comprising of statistical, Natural language processing and machine learning (15; 44{\%}) were the most common summarization approaches. Most studies (28; 82{\%}) conducted an intrinsic evaluation. Discussion: This is the first systematic review of text summarization in the biomedical domain. The study identified research gaps and provides recommendations for guiding future research on biomedical text summarization. Conclusion: Recent research has focused on a hybrid technique comprising statistical, language processing and machine learning techniques. Further research is needed on the application and evaluation of text summarization in real research or patient care settings.},

This paper presents and analyzes a range of learning methodologies, such as mobile learning, micro learning, personal learning, challenge-based learning, collaborative learning, and ubiquitous learning. In addition, the purpose of higher educational institutions and use of emerging technologies are also discussed. A systematic literature review was conducted on several learning methodologies and frameworks currently available to academics today in order to meet the challenges of enhancing and cultivating innovative mobile learning in the 21st century. For analyzing the contextual framework of each methodology, the study draws upon a wide range of resources, such as journals, articles, books and online repositories. Based on the findings of this review, a theoretical framework and learning methodology for innovative mobile learning is proposed, along with suggestions on how it can be implemented into the overall learning experience.},

abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of 840 SIGIR full papers and 215 TOIS papers published between 2006 and 2015. The original objective of the study was to identify IR effectiveness experiments that are seriously underpowered (i.e., the sample size is far too small so that the probability of missing a real difference is extremely high) or overpowered (i.e., the sample size is so large that a difference will be considered statistically significant even if the actual effect size is extremely small). However, it quickly became clear to us that many IR effectiveness papers either lack significance testing or fail to report p-values and/or test statistics, which prevents us from conducting power analysis. Hence we first report on how IR researchers (fail to) report on significance test results, what types of tests they use, and how the reporting practices may have changed over the last decade. From those papers that reported enough information for us to conduct power analysis, we identify extremely overpowered and underpowered experiments, as well as appropriate sample sizes for future experiments. The raw results of our systematic survey of 1,055 papers and our R scripts for power analysis are available online. Our hope is that this study will help improve the reporting practices and experimental designs of future IR effectiveness studies.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks have featured in a wide range of medical journals, often with promising results. This paper reports on a systematic review that was conducted to assess the benefit of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as decision making tools in the field of cancer. The number of clinical trials (CTs) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving the use of ANNs in diagnosis and prognosis increased from 1 to 38 in the last decade. However, out of 396 studies involving the use of ANNs in cancer, only 27 were either CTs or RCTs. Out of these trials, 21 showed an increase in benefit to healthcare provision and 6 did not. None of these studies however showed a decrease in benefit. This paper reviews the clinical fields where neural network methods figure most prominently, the main algorithms featured, methodologies for model selection and the need for rigorous evaluation of results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Feature Selection plays an important role in machine learning and data mining, and it is often applied as a data pre-processing step. This task can speed up learning algorithms and sometimes improve their performance. In multi-label learning, label dependence is considered another aspect that can contribute to improve learning performance. A replicable and wide systematic review performed by us corroborates this idea. Based on this information, it is believed that considering label dependence during feature selection can lead to better learning performance. The hypothesis of this work is that multi-label feature selection algorithms that consider label dependence will perform better than the ones that disregard it. To this end, we propose multi-label feature selection algorithms that take into account label relations. These algorithms were experimentally compared to the standard approach for feature selection, showing good performance in terms of feature reduction and predictability of the classifiers built using the selected features.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a complex progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder, being its prevalence expected to rise over the next decades. Unconventional strategies for elucidating the genetic mechanisms are necessary due to its polygenic nature. In this work, the input information sources are five: a public DNA microarray that measures expression levels of control and patient samples, repositories of known genes associated to Alzheimer's disease, additional data, Gene Ontology and finally, a literature review or expert knowledge to validate the results. As methodology to identify genes highly related to this disease, we present the integration of three machine learning techniques: particularly, we have used decision trees, quantitative association rules and hierarchical cluster to analyze Alzheimer's disease gene expression profiles to identify genes highly linked to this neurodegenerative disease, through changes in their expression levels between control and patient samples. We propose an ensemble of decision trees and quantitative association rules to find the most suitable configurations of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm GarNet, in order to overcome the complex parametrization intrinsic to this type of algorithms. To fulfill this goal, GarNet has been executed using multiple configuration settings and the well-known C4.5 has been used to find the minimum accuracy to be satisfied. Then, GarNet is rerun to identify dependencies between genes and their expression levels, so we are able to distinguish between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients using the configurations that overcome the minimum threshold of accuracy defined by C4.5 algorithm. Finally, a hierarchical cluster analysis has been used to validate the obtained gene-Alzheimer's Disease associations provided by GarNet. The results have shown that the obtained rules were able to successfully characterize the underlying information, grouping relevant genes for Alzheimer Disease. The genes reported by our approach provided two well defined groups that perfectly divided the samples between healthy and Alzheimer's Disease patients. To prove the relevance of the obtained results, a statistical test and gene expression fold-change were used. Furthermore, this relevance has been summarized in a volcano plot, showing two clearly separated and significant groups of genes that are up or down-regulated in Alzheimer's Disease patients. A biological knowledge integration phase was performed based on the information fusion of systematic literature review, enrichment Gene Ontology terms for the described genes found in the hippocampus of patients. Finally, a validation phase with additional data and a permutation test is carried out, being the results consistent with previous studies.},

abstract = {Millions of people around the world suffer from pain, acute or chronic and this raises the importance of its screening, assessment and treatment. Pain, is highly subjective and the use of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can play an important part in improving the accuracy of pain assessment, and lead to better clinical practices. This review examines CDSSs, in relation to computer technologies and was conducted with the following electronic databases: CiteSeerx, IEEE Xplore, ISI Web of Knowledge, Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search, PubMed, Science Accelerator, Science.gov, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and The Cochrane Library. The studies referenced were compiled with several criteria in mind. Firstly, that they constituted a decision support system. Secondly, that study data included pain values or results based on the detection of pain. Thirdly, that they were published in English, between 1992 and 2011, and finally that they focused on patients with acute or chronic pain. In total, thirty-nine studies highlighted the following topics: rule based algorithms, artificial neural networks, rough and fuzzy sets, statistical learning algorithms, terminologies, questionnaires and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53{\%} to 87.5{\%}. The lack of integration with mobile devices, the limited use of web-based interfaces and the scarcity of systems that allow for data to be inserted by patients were all limitations that were detected. {\textcopyright} 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract = {Secondary studies, such as systematic literature reviews and mapping studies, are an essential element of the evidence-based paradigm. A critical part of the review process is the identification of all relevant research. As such, any researcher intending to conduct a secondary review should be aware of the strengths and weakness of the search engines available. Analyse the overlap between search engine results for software engineering studies. Three independent studies were conducted to evaluate the overlap between multiple search engines for different search areas. The findings indicate that very little overlap was found between the search engines. To complete a systematic review, researchers must use multiple search terms and search engines. The lack of overlap might also be caused by inconsistent keyword selection amongst authors.},

abstract = {Clinical systematic reviews are based on expert, laborious search of well-annotated literature. Boolean search on bibliographic databases, such as medline, continues to be the preferred discovery method, but the size of these databases, now approaching 20 million records, makes it impossible to fully trust these searching methods. We are investigating the trade-oÔ¨Äs between Boolean and ranked retrieval. Our Ô¨Åndings show that although Boolean search has limitations, it is not obvious that ranking is superior, and illustrate that a single query cannot be used to resolve an information need. Our experiments show that a combination of less complicated Boolean queries and ranked retrieval outperforms either of them individually, leading to possible time savings over the current process.},

@article{Lopez-Martin:2015:PAC:2802870.2803059,
abstract = {To get a better prediction of costs, schedule, and the risks of a software project, it is necessary to have a more accurate prediction of its development effort. Among the main prediction techniques are those based on mathematical models, such as statistical regressions or machine learning (ML). The ML models applied to predicting the development effort have mainly based their conclusions on the following weaknesses: (1) using an accuracy criterion which leads to asymmetry, (2) applying a validation method that causes a conclusion instability by randomly selecting the samples for training and testing the models, (3) omitting the explanation of how the parameters for the neural networks were determined, (4) generating conclusions from models that were not trained and tested from mutually exclusive data sets, (5) omitting an analysis of the dependence, variance and normality of data for selecting the suitable statistical test for comparing the accuracies among models, and (6) reporting results without showing a statistically signi ficant difference. In this study, these six issues are addressed when comparing the prediction accuracy of a radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) with that of a regression statistical (the model most frequently compared with ML models), to feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP, the most commonly used in the effort prediction of software projects), and to general regression neural network (GRNN, a RBFNN variant). The hypothesis tested is the following: the accuracy of effort prediction for RBFNN is statistically better than the accuracy obtained from a simple linear regression (SLR), MLP and GRNN when adjusted function points data, obtained from software projects, is used as the independent variable. Samples obtained from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) Release 11 related to new and enhanced projects were used. The models were trained and tested from a leave-one-out cross-validation method. The criteria for evaluating the models were based on Absolute Residuals and by a Friedman statistical test. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the accuracy among the four models for new projects, but not for enhanced projects. Regarding new projects, the accuracy for RBFNN was better than for a SLR at the 99{\%} confidence level, whereas the MLP and GRNN were better than for a SLR at the 90{\%} confidence level.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the value of using a systematic literature review to develop an integrated framework for information and knowledge management systems. Design/methodology/approach First, the systematic literature review method is introduced, differentiating it from traditional literature reviews in terms of value-added and limitations. Second, this methodology is used in a research application focused on absorptive capacity internal capabilities with regard to the processes of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Third, an integrated framework for information and knowledge management systems is developed from this application. Findings The systematic literature review approach provides a rigor that can assist in reducing researcher bias while simultaneously enabling the definition of a precise scope of review, with a clear explanation of selection criteria with the objective to find and review all the studies that are relevant to the search definitions. As a research method, it effectively supports a qualitative, quantitative or mixed methodology. Research limitations/implications This methodology was applied to one specific area of research. Specific limitations include the availability of articles in subscribed databases and the analytical capabilities of the tools used for text mining and analytics. Originality/value This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the systematic literature review methodology in developing an integrated framework for analysis.},

abstract = {We followed a systematic approach based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to identify existing clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems that generate structured information from unstructured free text. Seven literature databases were searched with a query combining the concepts of natural language processing and structured data capture. Two reviewers screened all records for relevance during two screening phases, and information about clinical NLP systems was collected from the final set of papers. A total of 7149 records (after removing duplicates) were retrieved and screened, and 86 were determined to fit the review criteria. These papers contained information about 71 different clinical NLP systems, which were then analyzed. The NLP systems address a wide variety of important clinical and research tasks. Certain tasks are well addressed by the existing systems, while others remain as open challenges that only a small number of systems attempt, such as extraction of temporal information or normalization of concepts to standard terminologies. This review has identified many NLP systems capable of processing clinical free text and generating structured output, and the information collected and evaluated here will be important for prioritizing development of new approaches for clinical NLP.},

abstract = {Deep architectures with convolution structure have been found highly effective and been commonly used in computer vision and image recognition. With the introduction of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for general purpose issues, there has been an increasing attention towards exploiting GPU processing power for deep learning algorithms. Also, large amount of data online has made possible to train deep neural networks efficiently and to make networks perform a specific task. This paper aims to perform a systematic mapping study, in order to investigate existing research about implementations of computer vision approaches based on deep learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks. We select a total of 119 papers, which are classified according to field of interest, network type, learning paradigm, research type and contribution type. Our study demonstrates that this field is a promising area for research. We find out that the majority of papers deal with image search approaches (63 {\%}), use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as architecture (65 {\%}), use supervised learning paradigm (55 {\%}) and make use of GPU-acceleration (60 {\%}).},

abstract = {User-generated content (UGC) on theWeb, especially on social media platforms, facilitates the association of additional information with digital resources; thus, it can provide valuable supplementary content. However, UGC varies in quality and, consequently, raises the challenge of how to maximize its utility for a variety of end-users. This study aims to provide researchers andWeb data curators with comprehensive answers to the following questions: What are the existing approaches and methods for assessing and ranking UGC? What features and metrics have been used successfully to assess and predict UGC value across a range of application domains? What methods can be effectively employed to maximize that value? This survey is composed of a systematic review of approaches for assessing and ranking UGC: results are obtained by identifying and comparing methodologies within the context of short text-based UGC on the Web. Existing assessment and ranking approaches adopt one of four framework types: the community-based framework takes into consideration the value assigned to content by a crowd of humans, the end-user-based framework adapts and personalizes the assessment and ranking process with respect to a single end-user, the designer-based framework encodes the software designer's values in the assessment and ranking method, and the hybrid framework employs methods from more than one of these types. This survey suggests a need for further experimentation and encourages the development of new approaches for the assessment and ranking of UGC. {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Large-scale mappings of protein-protein interactions have started to give us new views of the complex molecular mechanisms inside a cell. After initial projects to systematically map protein interactions in model organisms such as yeast, worm and fly, researchers have begun to focus on the mapping of the human interactome. To tackle this enormous challenge, different approaches have been proposed and pursued. While several large-scale human protein interaction maps have recently been published, their quality remains to be critically assessed. RESULTS: We present here a first comparative analysis of eight currently available large-scale maps with a total of over 10,000 unique proteins and 57,000 interactions included. They are based either on literature search, orthology or by yeast-two-hybrid assays. Comparison reveals only a small, but statistically significant overlap. More importantly, our analysis gives clear indications that all interaction maps imply considerable selection and detection biases. These results have to be taken into account for future assembly of the human interactome. AVAILABILITY: An integrated human interaction network called Unified Human Interactome (UniHI) is made publicly accessible at http://www.mdc-berlin.de/unihi. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Hashimoto201659,
abstract = {Systematic reviews require expert reviewers to manually screen thousands of citations in order to identify all relevant articles to the review. Active learning text classification is a supervised machine learning approach that has been shown to significantly reduce the manual annotation workload by semi-automating the citation screening process of systematic reviews. In this paper, we present a new topic detection method that induces an informative representation of studies, to improve the performance of the underlying active learner. Our proposed topic detection method uses a neural network-based vector space model to capture semantic similarities between documents. We firstly represent documents within the vector space, and cluster the documents into a predefined number of clusters. The centroids of the clusters are treated as latent topics. We then represent each document as a mixture of latent topics. For evaluation purposes, we employ the active learning strategy using both our novel topic detection method and a baseline topic model (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Results obtained demonstrate that our method is able to achieve a high sensitivity of eligible studies and a significantly reduced manual annotation cost when compared to the baseline method. This observation is consistent across two clinical and three public health reviews. The tool introduced in this work is available from https://nactem.ac.uk/pvtopic/.},

abstract = {Objective The combination of phenomic data from electronic health records (EHR) and clinical data repositories with dense biological data has enabled genomic and pharmacogenomic discovery, a first step toward precision medicine. Computational methods for the identification of clinical phenotypes from EHR data will advance our understanding of disease risk and drug response, and support the practice of precision medicine on a national scale. Methods Based on our experience within three national research networks, we summarize the broad approaches to clinical phenotyping and highlight the important role of these networks in the progression of high-throughput phenotyping and precision medicine. We provide supporting literature in the form of a non-systematic review. Results The practice of clinical phenotyping is evolving to meet the growing demand for scalable, portable, and data driven methods and tools. The resources required for traditional phenotyping algorithms from expert defined rules are significant. In contrast, machine learning approaches that rely on data patterns will require fewer clinical domain experts and resources. Conclusions Machine learning approaches that generate phenotype definitions from patient features and clinical profiles will result in truly computational phenotypes, derived from data rather than experts. Research networks and phenotype developers should cooperate to develop methods, collaboration platforms, and data standards that will enable computational phenotyping and truly modernize biomedical research and precision medicine.},

abstract = {Mobile devices have become for many the preferred way of interacting with the Internet, social media and the enterprise. However, mobile devices still do not have the computing power or battery life that will allow them to perform effectively over long periods of time or for executing applications that require extensive communication or computation, or low latency. Cyber-foraging is a technique enabling mobile devices to extend their computing power and storage by offloading computation or data to more powerful servers located in the cloud or in single-hop proximity. This paper presents a catalog of architectural tactics for cyber-foraging that was derived from the results of a systematic literature review on architectures for cyber-foraging systems. Elements of the architectures identified in the primary studies were codified in the form of Architectural Tactics for Cyber- Foraging. These tactics will help architects extend their design reasoning towards cyber-foraging as a way to support the mobile applications of the present and the future.},

abstract = {This paper presents a formalism for considering the issues of learning in design. A foundation for machine learning in design (MLinD) is defined so as to provide answers to basic questions on learning in design, such as, "What types of knowledge can be learnt?", "How does learning occur?", and "When does learning occur?". Five main elements of MLinD are presented as the input knowledge, knowledge transformers, output knowledge, goals/reasons for learning, and learning triggers. Using this foundation, published systems in MLinD were reviewed. The systematic review presents a basis for validating the presented foundation. The paper concludes that there is considerable work to be carried out in order to fully formalize the foundation of MLinD.},

@phdthesis{Vaillette2004,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the use of a logical language for specifying mappings between strings of symbols; specifically, the regular relations, those which can be computed by finite-state transducers. Because of their efficiency and flexibility, regular relations and finite-state transducers are widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for tasks such as grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, morphological analysis and generation, and shallow syntactic parsing. By exploiting logical representations for finite-state transductions, the technique advocated in this thesis combines efficient processing with the advantages of declarative specification, thus taking a step in the direction of providing finite-state NLP with the best of both worlds. Previous work has demonstrated how all sets of strings recognized by finite-state automata can be described in monadic second-order logic. A formula of this logic describing a set can be automatically compiled into the finite-state automaton recognizing that set. This technique unfortunately does not carry over to relations on strings without further restrictions, since the class of regular relations lacks certain crucial closure properties. In this thesis we introduce the logical language MSO(SLR), a language for same-length relations, a proper subset of the regular relations which has the necessary closure properties. We discuss how a formula of MSO(SLR) describing a relation can be automatically compiled into the finite-state transducer implementing that relation. Although there are many regular relations which MSO(SLR) cannot describe directly, we show how MSO(SLR) can characterize such relations indirectly by describing aligned representations of them. To demonstrate the usefulness of MSO(SLR), we use it to define the finite-state conditional replace operator $\phi$ ‚Üí $\psi$ / $\lambda${\_}$\rho$ in a declarative fashion. We argue that this approach improves on previous definitions in terms of clarity, maintainability, extensibility, and formal verifiability. We justify these claims by discussing several extensions and variations of the operator and providing rigorous proofs of correctness for our definitions. A further demonstration of MSO(SLR)'s usefulness is given in the form of definitions of the rule formalisms used in two-level morphology. As with the replace operator definition, our declarative definitions give us a compiler automatically and make extensions and formal verification easy.},

abstract = {Sign language recognition (SLR) plays an important role in human-computer interaction (HCI), especially for the convenient communication between deaf and hearing society. How to enhance the traditional hidden Markov models (HMM) based SLR is an important issue in the SLR community. And how to refine the boundaries of the classifiers to effectively characterize the property of spread-out of the training samples is another significant issue. In this paper, a new classification framework applying adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) strategy to continuous HMM (CHMM) training procedure at the subwords classification level for SLR is presented. The ensemble of multiple composite CHMMs for each subword trained in boosting iterations tends to concentrate more on the hard-to-classify samples so as to generate more complex decision boundary than that of the single HMM classifier. Experimental results on the vocabulary of frequently used Chinese sign language (CSL) subwords show that the proposed boosted CHMM outperforms the conventional CHMM for SLR. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

abstract = {The demand for various multimedia applications is rapidly increasing due to the recent advance in the computing and network infrastructure, together with the widespread use of digital video technology. Among the key elements for the success of these applications is how to effectively and efficiently manage and store a huge amount of audio visual information, while at the same time providing user-friendly access to the stored data. This has fueled a quickly evolving research area known as video abstraction. As the name implies, video abstraction is a mechanism for generating a short summary of a video, which can either be a sequence of stationary images (keyframes) or moving images (video skims). In terms of browsing and navigation, a good video abstract will enable the user to gain maximum information about the target video sequence in a specified time constraint or sufficient information in the minimum time. Over past years, various ideas and techniques have been proposed towards the effective abstraction of video contents. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic classification of these works. We identify and detail, for each approach, the underlying components and how they are addressed in specific works.},

@article{Spola√¥r20163,
abstract = {Each example in a multi-label dataset is associated with multiple labels, which are often correlated. Learning from this data can be improved when dimensionality reduction tasks, such as feature selection, are applied. The standard approach for multi-label feature selection transforms the multi-label dataset into single-label datasets before using traditional feature selection algorithms. However, this approach often ignores label dependence. In this work, we propose an alternative method, LCFS, that constructs new labels based on relations between the original labels. By doing so, the label set from the data is augmented with second-order information before applying the standard approach. To assess LCFS, an experimental evaluation using Information Gain as a measure to estimate the importance of features was carried out on 10 benchmark multi-label datasets. This evaluation compared four LCFS settings with the standard approach, using random feature selection as a reference. For each dataset, the performance of a feature selection method is estimated by the quality of the classifiers built from the data described by the features selected by the method. The results show that a simple LCFS setting gave rise to classifiers similar to, or better than, the ones built using the standard approach. Furthermore, this work also pioneers the use of the systematic review method to survey the related work on multi-label feature selection. The summary of the 99 papers found promotes the idea that exploring label dependence during feature selection can lead to good results.},

abstract = {Database search strategies for systematic reviews are often developed subjectively and may miss relevant studies. We examined whether objective methods, originally developed to identify systematic reviews, could be applied to a multidisciplinary topic, alcohol-impaired driving (AID). We performed word-frequency analyses of titles/abstracts/keywords on citations randomly selected from a 'gold standard' database of 131 controlled studies evaluating AID interventions. Identified words were tested in the Web of Science databases for sensitivity, precision, and feasibility. Words meeting varying sensitivity and precision thresholds were combined into search strategies. All threshold combinations with cumulative sensitivity of at least 75{\%} retrieved ‚â• 100,000 citations. The word frequency-based procedure was therefore modified, first by eliminating non-specific words, then by categorizing and combining the remaining words. With these modifications, sensitivity was 80.0{\%} and precision 4.4{\%}, retrieving 17,565 citations. Against a validation set, sensitivity was 85.7{\%} and precision 3.5{\%}. To identify studies on multidisciplinary topics, objective methods may be useful initially but may need to be modified to meet sensitivity and feasibility targets. {\textcopyright} CILIP.},

Initially we define a rigorous protocol to lead the process. In the first phase, we create a systematic mapping of the area. In addition, from the complete reading of each article, a panorama of this area is presented. We reveal the search engines that most publicize this topic and which publishing types, authors and research institutions are involved in these papers. Moreover we identify the algorithms and the classes of these algorithms most compared over the years, how are made these comparisons, as well as their availabilities. Therefore this systematic review becomes a rich material for understanding this knowledge area.},

abstract = {The heuristic search processes like simple genetic algorithms help in achieving optimization but do not guarantee robustness so there is an immediate need of a machine learning technique that also promises robustness. Diploid genetic algorithms ensure consistent results and can therefore replace Simple genetic algorithms in applications such as test data generation and regression testing, where robustness is more important. However, there is a need to review the work that has been done so far in the field. It is also important to analyse the applicability of the premise of the dominance techniques applied so far in order to implement the technique. The work presents a systematic review of diploid genetic algorithms, examines the premise of the dominance relation used in different works and discusses the future scope. The work also discusses the biological basis of evaluating dominance. The work is important as the future of machine learning relies on techniques that are robust as well as efficient.},

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.},

We selected full review comparative studies, usability studies, and qualitative studies examining infobutton design and implementation. We abstracted usability measures such as user satisfaction, impact, and efficiency, as well as prediction accuracy of infobutton content retrieval algorithms and infobutton adoption/interoperability. Results We found 82 original research studies on infobuttons. Twelve studies met criteria for detailed abstraction. These studies investigated infobutton interoperability (1 study); tools to help tailor infobutton functionality (1 study); interventions to improve user experience (7 studies); and interventions to improve content retrieval by improving prediction of relevant knowledge resources and information needs (3 studies). In-depth interviews with implementers showed the Health Level Seven (HL7) Infobutton standard to be simple and easy to implement. A usability study demonstrated the feasibility of a tool to help medical librarians tailor infobutton functionality. User experience studies showed that access to resources with which users are familiar increased user satisfaction ratings; and that links to specific subsections of drug monographs increased information seeking efficiency. However, none of the user experience improvements led to increased usage uptake. Recommender systems based on machine learning algorithms outperformed hand-crafted rules in the prediction of relevant resources and clinicians' information needs in a laboratory setting, but no studies were found using these techniques in clinical settings. Improved content indexing in one study led to improved content retrieval across three health care organizations. Conclusion Best practice technical approaches to ensure optimal infobutton functionality, design and implementation remain understudied. The HL7 Infobutton standard has supported wide adoption of infobutton functionality among clinical information systems and knowledge resources. Limited evidence supports infobutton enhancements such as links to specific subtopics, configuration of optimal resources for specific tasks and users, and improved indexing and content coverage. Further research is needed to investigate user experience improvements to increase infobutton use and effectiveness.},

abstract = {The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54{\%}). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30{\%}), rehabilitation (7, 35{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20{\%}), falls (2, 10{\%}) and mental health (1, 5{\%}). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and ‚Äòsilo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.},

abstract = {We present novel machine learning and data mining methods that make real-world learning systems more efficient. We focus on the domain of clinical informatics, an archetypical example of a field overwhelmed with information. Due to properties inherent to clinical informatics tasks ‚Äì and indeed, to many tasks that require specialized domain knowledge ‚Äì 'off-the-shelf' machine learning technologies generally perform poorly in this domain. If machine learning is to be successful in clinical science, novel methods must be developed to: mitigate the effects of class imbalance during model induction; exploit the wealth of domain knowledge highly skilled domain experts bring to the task; and to induce better models with less effort (fewer labels). We present new machine learning methods that address each of these issues, and demonstrate their efficacy in the task of abstract screening. In particular, we develop new theoretical perspectives on class imbalance, novel methods for exploiting dual supervision (i.e., labels on both instances and features), and new active learning techniques that address issues inherent to real-world applications (e.g., exploiting multiple experts in tandem). Each of these contributions aims to squeeze better classification performance out of fewer labels, thereby making better use of domain experts' time and expertise. The immediate aim in this work is to reduce the workload involved in conducting systematic reviews, and to this end we demonstrate that the developed methods can reduce reviewer workload by more than half, without sacrificing the comprehensiveness of reviews (i.e., without missing any relevant published evidence). But this is only an exemplary task; the approaches presented here have wider application to many real-world learning problems, i.e., those that require specialized expertise, exhibit class imbalance (and asymmetric costs) and for which limited human resources are available. We show that the methods we have developed bring substantial improvements over previously existing machine learning approaches in terms of inducing better models with less effort.},

abstract = {The PICO process is a technique used in evidence based practice to frame and answer clinical questions. It involves structuring the question around four types of clinical information: population, intervention, control or comparison and outcome. The PICO framework is used extensively in the compilation of systematic reviews as the means of framing research questions. However, when a search strategy (comprising of a large Boolean query) is formulated to retrieve studies for inclusion in the review, PICO is often ignored. This paper evaluates how PICO annotations can be applied and integrated into retrieval to improve the screening of studies for inclusion in systematic reviews. The task is to increase precision while maintaining the high level of recall essential to ensure systematic reviews are representative and unbiased. Our results show that restricting the search strategies to match studies using PICO annotations improves precision, however recall is slightly reduced, when compared to the non-PICO baseline. This can lead to both time and cost savings when compiling systematic reviews.},

abstract = {Background and objective Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), which can significantly decrease the quality of life is associated with a major risk factor of health implications such as increased cardiovascular disease, sudden death, depression, irritability, hypertension, and learning difficulties. Thus, it is relevant and timely to present a systematic review describing significant applications in the framework of computational intelligence-based SAS, including its performance, beneficial and challenging effects, and modeling for the decision-making on multiple scenarios. Methods This study aims to systematically review the literature on systems for the detection and/or prediction of apnea events using a classification model. Results Forty-five included studies revealed a combination of classification techniques for the diagnosis of apnea, such as threshold-based (14.75{\%}) and machine learning (ML) models (85.25{\%}). In addition, the ML models, were clustered in a mind map, include neural networks (44.26{\%}), regression (4.91{\%}), instance-based (11.47{\%}), Bayesian algorithms (1.63{\%}), reinforcement learning (4.91{\%}), dimensionality reduction (8.19{\%}), ensemble learning (6.55{\%}), and decision trees (3.27{\%}). Conclusions A classification model should provide an auto-adaptive and no external-human action dependency. In addition, the accuracy of the classification models is related with the effective features selection. New high-quality studies based on randomized controlled trials and validation of models using a large and multiple sample of data are recommended.},

abstract = {This paper describes our work in semantic interpretation of a "multimodal language" with speech and gestures using latent semantic analysis (LSA). Our aim is to infer the domain-specific informational goal of multimodal inputs. The informational goal is characterized by lexical terms used in the spoken modality, partial semantics of gestures in the pen modality, as well as term co-occurrence patterns across modalities, leading to " multimodal terms." We designed and collected a multimodal corpus of navigational inquiries. We also obtained perfect (i.e. manual) and imperfect (i.e. automatic via recognition) transcriptions for these. We automatically align parsed spoken locative references (SLRs) with their corresponding pen gesture(s) using the Viterbi alignment, according to their numeric and location type features. Then, we characterize each cross-modal integration pattern as a 3-tuple multimodal term with SLR, pen gesture type and their temporal relationship. We propose to use latent semantic analysis (LSA) to derive the latent semantics from manual (i.e. perfect) and automatic (i.e. imperfect) transcriptions of the collected multimodal inputs. In order to achieve this, both multimodal and lexical terms are used to compose an inquiry-term matrix, which is then factorized using singular value decomposition (SVD) to derive the latent semantics automatically. Informational goal inference based on the latent semantics shows that the informational goal inference accuracy of a disjoint test set is 99{\%} and 84{\%} when a perfect and imperfect projection model is used respectively, which performs significantly better than (at least 9.9{\%} absolute) the baseline performance using vector-space model (VSM).},

abstract = {We describe a prototype for a hybrid system designed to reduce the number of citations needed to re-screen (NNRS) by systematic reviewers, where citations include titles, abstracts, and metadata. The system obviates the need for screening the entire set of citations a second time, which is typically done to control human error. The reference set is based on a complex review about organ transplantation (N=10,796 citations). Data were split into 50{\%} training and test sets, randomly stratified for percentage eligible citations. The system consists of a rule-based module and a machine-learning (ML) module. The former substantially reduces the number of negative citations passed to the ML module and improves imbalance. Relative to the baseline, the system reduces classification error (5.6{\%} vs 2.9{\%}) thereby reducing NNRS by 47.3{\%} (300 vs 158). We discuss the implications of de-emphasizing sensitivity (recall) in favor of specificity and negative predictive value to reduce screening burden.},

abstract = {In industrial organisations, software products are quite large and complex, consisting of a number of classes. Thus, it is not possible to test all the products with a finite number of resources. Hence, it would be beneficial if we could predict in advance some of the attributes associated with the classes such as change proneness, defect proneness, maintenance effort, etc. In this paper, we have dealt with one of the quality attributes, i.e., change proneness. Changes in the software are unavoidable and thus, early prediction of change proneness will help the developers to focus the limited resources on the classes which are predicted to be change-prone. We have conducted a systematic review which evaluates all the available important studies relevant to the area of change proneness. This will help us to identify gaps in the current technology and discuss possible new directions of research in the areas related to change proneness.},

abstract = {In sign language recognition (SLR) with multimodal data, a sign word can be represented by multiply features, for which there exist an intrinsic property and a mutually complementary relationship among them. To fully explore those relationships, we propose an online early-late fusion method based on the adaptive Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In terms of the intrinsic property, we discover that inherent latent change states of each sign are related not only to the number of key gestures and body poses but also to their translation relationships. We propose an adaptive HMM method to obtain the hidden state number of each sign by affinity propagation clustering. For the complementary relationship, we propose an online early-late fusion scheme. The early fusion (feature fusion) is dedicated to preserving useful information to achieve a better complementary score, while the late fusion (score fusion) uncovers the significance of those features and aggregates them in a weighting manner. Different from classical fusion methods, the fusion is query adaptive. For different queries, after feature selection (including the combined feature), the fusion weight is inversely proportional to the area under the curve of the normalized query score list for each selected feature. The whole fusion process is effective and efficient. Experiments verify the effectiveness on the signer-independent SLR with large vocabulary. Compared either on different dataset sizes or to different SLR models, our method demonstrates consistent and promising performance.},

@article{Bezgin:2008:SID:1450342.1450480,
abstract = {We propose a new technique, called Spatial Objective Relational Transformation (SORT), as an automated approach for derivation of logical relationships between cortical areas in different brain maps registered in the same Euclidean space. Recently, there have been large amounts of voxel-based three-dimensional structural and functional imaging data that provide us with coordinate-based information about the location of differently defined areas in the brain, whereas coordinate-independent, parcellation-based mapping is still commonly used in the majority of animal tracing and mapping studies. Because of the impact of voxel-based imaging methods and the need to attribute their features to coordinate-independent brain entities, this mapping becomes increasingly important. Our motivation here is not to make vague statements where more precise spatial statements would be better, but to find criteria for the identity (or other logical relationships) between areas that were delineated by different methods, in different individuals, or mapped to three-dimensional space using different deformation algorithms. The relevance of this problem becomes immediately obvious as one superimposes and compares different datasets in multimodal databases (e.g.¬†CARET, http://brainmap.wustl.edu/caret), where voxel-based data are registered to surface nodes exploited by the procedure presented here. We describe the SORT algorithm and its implementation in the Java 2 programming language (http://java.sun.com/, which we make available for download. We give an example of practical use of our approach, and validate the SORT approach against a database of the coordinate-independent statements and inferences that have been deduced using alternative techniques. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In recent years, fuzzy logic techniques have been successfully applied in geodesy problems, in particular to GPS. The aim of this work is to test a fuzzy-logic method with an enhanced probability function as a tool to provide a reliable criteria for weighting scheme for satellite-laser-ranging (SLR) station observations, seeking to optimize their contribution to the precise orbit determination (POD) problem. The data regarding the stations were provided by the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), NASA/Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS) provided the satellite data for testing the method. The software for processing the data is GEODYN II provided by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Factors to be considered in the fuzzy-logic clustering are: the total number of LAGEOS passes during the past 12 months, the stability measure of short- and long-term biases, the percentage of LAGEOS normal points that were accepted in CSR weekly LAGEOS analysis, and the RMS uncertainty of the station coordinates. A fuzzy-logic statistical method allows classifying the stations through a clear 'degree of belonging' to each station group. This degree of belonging translates into a suitable weight to be assigned to each station in the global solution. The first tests carried out showed improvements in the RMS of the global POD solution as well as individual stations, to within a few millimeters. We expect further work would lead to further improvements. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ascertaining the similarity amongst molecules is a fundamental problem in biology and drug discovery. Since similar molecules tend to have similar biological properties, the notion of molecular similarity plays an important role in exploration of molecular structural space, query-retrieval in molecular databases, and in structure-activity modeling. This problem is related to the issue of molecular representation. Currently, approaches with high descriptive power like 3D surface-based representations are available. However, most techniques tend to focus on 2D graph-based molecular similarity due to the complexity that accompanies reasoning with more elaborate representations. This paper addresses the problem of determining similarity when molecules are described using complex surface-based representations. It proposes an intrinsic, spherical representation that systematically maps points on a molecular surface to points on a standard coordinate system (a sphere). Molecular geometry, molecular fields, and effects due to field super-positioning can then be captured as distributions on the surface of the sphere. Molecular similarity is obtained by computing the similarity of the corresponding property distributions using a novel formulation of histogram-intersection. This method is robust to noise, obviates molecular pose-optimization, can incorporate conformational variations, and facilitates highly efficient determination of similarity. Retrieval performance, applications in structure-activity modeling of complex biological properties, and comparisons with existing research and commercial methods demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the approach.},

abstract = {Text data include all kinds of natural language text such as web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media posts. As text data continues to grow quickly, it is increasingly important to develop intelligent systems to help people manage and make use of vast amounts of text data ("big text data"). As a new family of effective general approaches to text data retrieval and analysis, probabilistic topic models, notably Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDA), and many extensions of them, have been studied actively in the past decade with widespread applications. These topic models are powerful tools for extracting and analyzing latent topics contained in text data; they also provide a general and robust latent semantic representation of text data, thus improving many applications in information retrieval and text mining. Since they are general and robust, they can be applied to text data in any natural language and about any topics. This tutorial will systematically review the major research progress in probabilistic topic models and discuss their applications in text retrieval and text mining. The tutorial will provide (1) an in-depth explanation of the basic concepts, underlying principles, and the two basic topic models (i.e., PLSA and LDA) that have widespread applications, (2) a broad overview of all the major representative topic models (that are usually extensions of PLSA or LDA), and (3) a discussion of major challenges and future research directions. The tutorial should be appealing to anyone who would like to learn about topic models, how and why they work, their widespread applications, and the remaining research challenges to be solved, including especially graduate students, researchers who want to develop new topic models, and practitioners who want to apply topic models to solve many application problems. The attendants are expected to have basic knowledge of probability and statistics.},

In this context, this paper presents the SESRA -- a web-based automated tool to support all phases of the SLR process, contributing to its productivity and reliability. We also present a use case on the software engineering field, applying specific knowledge to set the process in the discipline. Further, we discuss how to use the tool to establish a more formal and controlled process and to reduce effort on its repetitive activities.

abstract = {Context: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are an important component to identify and aggregate research evidence from different empirical studies. Despite its relevance, most of the process is conducted manually, implying additional effort when the Selection Review task is performed and leading to reading all studies under analysis more than once. Objective: We propose an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques to assist the Selection Review task in SLR. It is implemented into a VTM tool (Revis), which is freely available for use. Method: We have selected and implemented appropriate visualization techniques into our approach and validated and demonstrated its usefulness in performing real SLRs. Results: The results have shown that employment of VTM techniques can successfully assist in the Selection Review task, speeding up the entire SLR process in comparison to the conventional approach. Conclusion: VTM techniques are valuable tools to be used in the context of selecting studies in the SLR process, prone to speed up some stages of SLRs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Objectives Extracting data from publication reports is a standard process in systematic review (SR) development. However, the data extraction process still relies too much on manual effort which is slow, costly, and subject to human error. In this study, we developed a text summarization system aimed at enhancing productivity and reducing errors in the traditional data extraction process. Methods We developed a computer system that used machine learning and natural language processing approaches to automatically generate summaries of full-text scientific publications. The summaries at the sentence and fragment levels were evaluated in finding common clinical SR data elements such as sample size, group size, and PICO values. We compared the computer-generated summaries with human written summaries (title and abstract) in terms of the presence of necessary information for the data extraction as presented in the Cochrane review's study characteristics tables. Results At the sentence level, the computer-generated summaries covered more information than humans do for systematic reviews (recall 91.2{\%} vs. 83.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). They also had a better density of relevant sentences (precision 59{\%} vs. 39{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). At the fragment level, the ensemble approach combining rule-based, concept mapping, and dictionary-based methods performed better than individual methods alone, achieving an 84.7{\%} F-measure. Conclusion Computer-generated summaries are potential alternative information sources for data extraction in systematic review development. Machine learning and natural language processing are promising approaches to the development of such an extractive summarization system.},

Different ensemble approaches are frequently introduced to unify the desired classifiers for the improvement of sentimental classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study is available yet that investigate and summarize the leading ensemble approaches, classifiers, features, tools and datasets altogether in the domain of sentimental analysis. Therefore, in this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to identify 31 studies published during 2008--2016. Subsequently, 14 modern ensemble techniques, 26 leading classifiers, 15 benchmark datasets, 19 prominent features and 8 tools are presented in the context of sentimental analysis.

abstract = {Information retrieval algorithms have changed the way we manage and use various data sources, such as images, music or multimedia collections. First, free text information of documents from varying sources became accessible in addition to structured data in databases, initially for exact search and then for more probabilistic models. Novel approaches enable content-based visual search of images using computerized image analysis making visual image content searchable without requiring high quality manual annotations. Other multimedia data followed such as video and music retrieval, sometimes based on techniques such as extracting objects and classifying genre. 3D (surface) objects and solid textures have also been produced in quickly increasing quantities, for example in medical tomographic imaging. For these two types of 3D information sources, systems have become available to characterize the objects or textures and search for similar visual content in large databases. With 3D moving sequences (i.e., 4D), in particular medical imaging, even higher-dimensional data have become available for analysis and retrieval and currently present many multimedia retrieval challenges. This article systematically reviews current techniques in various fields of 3D and 4D visual information retrieval and analyses the currently dominating application areas. The employed techniques are analysed and regrouped to highlight similarities and complementarities among them in order to guide the choice of optimal approaches for new 3D and 4D retrieval problems. Opportunities for future applications conclude the article. 3D or higher-dimensional visual information retrieval is expected to grow quickly in the coming years and in this respect this article can serve as a basis for designing new applications.},

This research introduces an automatic system that detects contradiction between research claims using their assertion value with respect to a question. The system uses a machine learning algorithm (SVM) to construct a classifier that uses multiple linguistic features to recognise a claim's assertion value. The classifier is developed using a dataset consisting of 258 claims distributed in 24 groups, where each group answers a single research question. The classifier achieved ROC Score of 89{\%} and precision/recall of 87.3{\%}, compared against a baseline of 68{\%}. The system enables researchers carrying out systematic reviews to visually identify potentially contradictory research claims. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Systematic review is the scientific process that provides reliable answers to a particular research question. There is a significant shift from using manual human approach to decision support tools that provides a semi-automated screening phase by reducing the required time and effort. Text classification is useful in determining the statistical significance level of association rules to reduce workload in the systematic review. Several approaches to generate a Rule set for rule based classifiers were proposed in the literature. In this paper, we show that statistic as well as semantic measures of a rule can be combined and effectively computed as a hybrid feature selection rule measure (HFSRM). Moreover, we propose a new algorithm called Rules7-hybrid feature selection (Rules7-HFSRM) by combining the classical algorithm Rules7 and the HFSRM and then used it on the systematic review problem. Our results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms in the systematic review context.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether SVM-based classifiers, which are trained on a combination of inclusion and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new systematic reviews. Methods: Test collections were built using the annotated reference files from 19 procedure and 4 drug systematic reviews. The classifiers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of included and commonly excluded articles and one with a combination of included and excluded articles. AUCs were used as evaluation metrics. Results: The AUCs of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and commonly excluded articles, were significantly higher than those of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and excluded articles. Conclusion: Automatic, high-quality article classifiers using machine learning could reduce the workload of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-specific data are scarce. In particular, when used as training data, a combination of included and commonly excluded articles is more helpful than a combination of included and excluded articles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Context: An enormous number of papers (more than 70,000) have been published in the area of Software Engineering (SE) since its inception in 1968. To better characterize and understand this massive research literature, there is a need for comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Objective: The objective of this study is to utilize automated citation and topic analysis to characterize the software engineering research literature over the years. While a few bibliometrics studies have appeared in the field of SE, this article aims to be the most comprehensive bibliometrics assessments in this vibrant field.Method: To achieve the above objective, we report in this paper a bibliometrics study with data collected from Scopus database consisting of over 70,000 articles. For thematic analysis, we used topic modeling to automatically generate the most probable topic distributions given the data.Results: We found that number of papers published per year has grown tremendously and currently 6000-7000 papers are published every year. At the same time, nearly half of the papers are not cited at all. Using text mining of articles titles, we found that currently the hot research topics in software engineering are: (1) web services, (2) mobile and cloud computing, (3) industrial (case) studies, (4) source code and (5) test generation. Finally, we found that a small share of large countries produce the majority of the papers in SE while small European countries are proportionally the most active in the area of SE, based on the number of papers.Conclusion: Due to large volumes of research in SE, we suggest using the automated analysis of bibliometrics as we have done in this paper. By picking out the most cited papers, we can present the land marks of SE and, with thematic analysis, we can characterize the entire field. This can be useful for students and other new comers to SE and for presenting our achievements to other disciplines. In particular, we see and report the value of such an analysis in situations where performing a full scale SLR is not feasible due to restrictions on time or to lack of exact research questions.},

abstract = {The General Practice Research Database (GPRD) is a collection of anonymised patient records obtained from UK general practices. Data are representative of approximately 8{\%} of the UK population and are collected mainly for research purposes, which include assessing risk factors for disease, evaluating the side effects of drugs and comparing the effectiveness of different drugs. The data are used internationally by academics, governments and the pharmaceutical industry. As research findings arising from GPRD data may have potential public health and safety implications it is crucial importance that the data collected is of high quality. Data quality may vary within and between practices and may depend on the time of data collection. Although the GPRD's established framework for assessing data quality is comprehensive, it does not allow a systematic review of individual practice data quality markers. We are developing a framework for further improvement of existing methods of data quality assessment. We shall extend a set of current quality measures for each practice and, using statistical pattern recognition techniques, shall develop algorithms that will combine these measures into a smaller number of meaningful quality scores which will reflect different aspects of data quality and can be measured over time. We report the aims and rationale of the study and preliminary results. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Spam is information crafted to be delivered to a large number of recipients, in spite of their wishes. A spam filter is an automated tool to recognize spam so as to prevent its delivery. The purposes of spam and spam filters are diametrically opposed: spam is effective if it evades filters, while a filter is effective if it recognizes spam. The circular nature of these definitions, along with their appeal to the intent of sender and recipient make them difficult to formalize. A typical email user has a working definition no more formal than "I know it when I see it." Yet, current spam filters are remarkably effective, more effective than might be expected given the level of uncertainty and debate over a formal definition of spam, more effective than might be expected given the state-of-the-art information retrieval and machine learning methods for seemingly similar problems. But are they effective enough? Which are better? How might they be improved? Will their effectiveness be compromised by more cleverly crafted spam? We survey current and proposed spam filtering techniques with particular emphasis on how well they work. Our primary focus is spam filtering in email; Similarities and differences with spam filtering in other communication and storage media - such as instant messaging and the Web - are addressed peripherally. In doing so we examine the definition of spam, the user's information requirements and the role of the spam filter as one component of a large and complex information universe. Well-known methods are detailed sufficiently to make the exposition self-contained, however, the focus is on considerations unique to spam. Comparisons, wherever possible, use common evaluation measures, and control for differences in experimental setup. Such comparisons are not easy, as benchmarks, measures, and methods for evaluating spam filters are still evolving. We survey these efforts, their results and their limitations. In spite of recent advances in evaluation methodology, many uncertainties (including widely held but unsubstantiated beliefs) remain as to the effectiveness of spam filtering techniques and as to the validity of spam filter evaluation methods. We outline several uncertainties and propose experimental methods to address them.},

abstract = {Grammars are widely used to describe string languages such as programming and natural languages and, more recently, biosequences. Moreover, since the 1980s grammars have been used in computer vision and related areas. Some factors accountable for this increasing use regard its relatively simple understanding and its ability to represent some semantic pattern models found in images, both spatially and temporally. The objective of this article is to present an overview regarding the use of syntactic pattern recognition methods in image representations in several applications. To achieve this purpose, we used a systematic review process to investigate the main digital libraries in the area and to document the phases of the study in order to allow the auditing and further investigation. The results indicated that in some of the studies retrieved, manually created grammars were used to comply with a particular purpose. Other studies performed a learning process of the grammatical rules. In addition, this article also points out still unexplored research opportunities in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Rapid growth of sensor and computing platforms have introduced the wearable systems. In recent years, wearable systems have led to new applications across all medical fields. The aim of this review is to present current state-of-the-art approach in the field of wearable system based cancer detection and identify key challenges that resist it from clinical adoption. A total of 472 records were screened and 11 were finally included in this study. Two types of records were studied in this context that includes 45{\%} research articles and 55{\%} manufactured products. The review was performed per PRISMA guidelines where considerations was given to records that were published or reported between 2009 and 2017. The identified records included 4 cancer detecting wearable systems such as breast cancer (36.3{\%}), skin cancer (36.3{\%}), prostate cancer (18.1{\%}), and multi-type cancer (9{\%}). Most works involved sensor based smart systems comprising of microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and smart phone. Few demonstrated Ultra-Wide Band (i.e. UWB) antenna based wearable systems. Skin cancer detecting wearable systems were most comprehensible ones. The current works are gradually progressing with seamless integration of sensory units along with smart networking. However, they lack in cloud computing and long-range communication paradigms. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are key ports that need to be attached with current wearable systems. Further, clinical inertia, lack of awareness, and high cost are altogether pulling back the actual growth of such system. It is well comprehended that upon sincere orientation of all identified challenges, wearable systems would emerge as vital alternative to futuristic cancer detection.},

abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are one of the least biased sources of clinical research evidence, and are therefore a critical resource for the practice of evidence-based medicine. With over 10,000 new RCTs indexed in Medline each year, knowledge systems are needed to help clinicians translate evidence into practice. Common ontologies for RCTs and other domains would facilitate the development of these knowledge systems. However, no standard method exists for developing domain ontologies. In this paper, we describe a new systematic approach to specifying and evaluating the conceptual content of ontologies. In this method, called competency decomposition, the target task for an ontology is hierarchically decomposed into subtasks and methods, and the ontology content is specified by identifying the domain information required to complete each of the subtasks. We illustrate the use of this competency decomposition approach for the content specification and evaluation of an RCT ontology for evidence-based practice. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.},

RQ1: Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM 

RQ2: a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach; Previous findings reported by Malheiros et al. [10] show that the use of VTM reduces the time taken to perform the selection activity and also improves the number of papers correctly included or excluded in SLRs.

RQ3: time taken - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; 
effectiveness - of the study selection activity in the SLR process?; Table 1
Our results showed that the time taken by students 1 and 2 to perform the study selection activity on the basis of reading the abstracts was 85 and 54 minutes respectively; and the time taken by students 3 and 4 to perform the same activity using the VTM approach was 30 and 58 minutes respectively. The performance of the students using the VTM appeared to be either equivalent to or better than that of the students using the manual method.

RQ4: to support the primary study selection activity

abstract = {The wealth of medical-related information available today gives rise to a multidimensional source of knowledge. Research discoveries published in prestigious venues, electronic-health records data, discharge summaries, clinical notes, etc., all represent important medical information that can assist in the medical decision-making process. The challenge that comes with accessing and using such vast and diverse sources of data stands in the ability to distil and extract reliable and relevant information. Computer-based tools that use natural language processing and machine learning techniques have proven to help address such challenges. This current work proposes automatic reliable solutions for solving tasks that can help achieve a personalized-medicine, a medical practice that brings together general medical knowledge and case-specific medical information. Phenotypic medical observations, along with data coming from test results, are not enough when assessing and treating a medical case. Genetic, life-style, background and environmental data also need to be taken into account in the medical decision process. This thesis's goal is to prove that natural language processing and machine learning techniques represent reliable solutions for solving important medical-related problems. From the numerous research problems that need to be answered when implementing personalized medicine, the scope of this thesis is restricted to four, as follows: 1. Automatic identification of obesity-related diseases by using only textual clinical data; 2. Automatic identification of relevant abstracts of published research to be used for building systematic reviews; 3. Automatic identification of gene functions based on textual data of published medical abstracts; 4. Automatic identification and classification of important medical relations between medical concepts in clinical and technical data. This thesis investigation on finding automatic solutions for achieving a personalized medicine through information identification and extraction focused on individual specific problems that can be later linked in a puzzle-building manner. A diverse representation technique that follows a divide-and-conquer methodological approach shows to be the most reliable solution for building automatic models that solve the above mentioned tasks. The methodologies that I propose are supported by in-depth research experiments and thorough discussions and conclusions.},

abstract = {This paper compares different approaches for using deep neural networks (DNNs) trained to predict senone posteriors for the task of spoken language recognition (SLR). These approaches have recently been found to outperform various baseline systems on different datasets, but they have not yet been compared to each other or to a common baseline. Two of these approaches use the DNNs to generate feature vectors which are then processed in different ways to predict the score of each language given a test sample. The features are extracted either from a bottleneck layer in the DNN or from the output layer. In the third approach, the standard i-vector extraction procedure is modified to use the senones as classes and the DNN to predict the zeroth order statistics. We compare these three approaches and conclude that the approach based on bottleneck features followed by i-vector modeling outperform the other two approaches. We also show that score-level fusion of some of these approaches leads to gains over using a single approach for short-duration test samples. Finally, we demonstrate that fusing systems that use DNNs trained with several languages leads to improvements in performance over the best single system, and we propose an adaptation procedure for DNNs trained with languages with less available data. Overall, we show improvements between 40{\%} and 70{\%} relative to a state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM) i-vector system on test durations from 3 seconds to 120 seconds on two significantly different tasks: the NIST 2009 language recognition evaluation task and the DARPA RATS language identification task.},

abstract = {Motivation: A tandem repeat in DNA is a sequence of two or more contiguous, approximate copies of a pattern of nucleotides. Tandem repeats occur in the genomes of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. They are important in numerous fields including disease diagnosis, mapping studies, human identity testing (DNA fingerprinting), sequence homology and population studies. Although tandem repeats have been used by biologists for many years, there are few tools available for performing an exhaustive search for all tandem repeats in a given sequence. Results: In this paper we describe an efficient algorithm for finding all tandem repeats within a sequence, under the edit distance measure. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: theoretical and practical. We present a precise definition for tandem repeats over the edit distance and an efficient, deterministic algorithm for finding these repeats. Availability: The algorithm has been implemented in C++, and the software is available upon request and can be used at http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/{\~{}}sokol/trepeats. The use of this tool will assist biologists in discovering new ways that tandem repeats affect both the structure and function of DNA and protein molecules.

abstract = {Growth in the electronic games industry is evidenced by numerous reports citing an increasing proportion of "gamers" in the general population. Of particular interest is the shift in the conceptualization of the "typical gamer" from a very narrow stereotypical player to those meeting a much broader set of demographic characteristics. This has perhaps occurred in synergy with expansion in the types of games available. Similarly, we hypothesize that diversification has also occurred in academic research on games, primarily as a result of a simultaneous increase in interest in the use of electronic games for purposes beyond entertainment. In this research we extract 7842 distinct academic publications from major publishing databases to explore temporal patterns in the number of publications in the area of computer games. We also consider changes in disciplinary diversity over time. Our results show that computer game related research has undergone three development periods: the hibernation period from 1957 to 1980, the emergence period from 1981 to 2003, and the active period from 2004 to 2013. The broad domain of 'science technology' received the highest level of research interest among the three research domains: 'science technology,' 'social sciences', and 'arts humanities'. Interestingly, 'learning', in the context of computer games, has become a popular research topic from 2004. We also propose future work to extend our analysis to author collaboration and country of origin to inform understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns in game-related research.},

abstract = {While knowledge querying is a key capability of ontologies, the query language recommended by W3C, SPARQL, is not easy to use for some user types, e.g., casual users and domain experts. To improve this drawback, user-friendly Ontology Query Tools (OQTs) have been introduced. However, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive framework for researchers and practitioners to compare the capabilities of the wide range of available OQTs. In this paper we introduce, based on a systematic literature review, a framework that allows researchers and practitioners to classify and compare OQTs regarding their capabilities and their support for relevant user types and scenarios. We evaluate the framework based on a real-world use case. Major result of the evaluation was that the framework was found useful and usable by users from the target audience to identify the most suitable OQTs for their context.},

abstract = {Preparing a systematic review can take hundreds of hours to complete, but the process of reconciling different results from multiple studies is the bedrock of evidence-based medicine. We introduce a two-step approach to automatically extract three facets - two entities (the agent and object) and the way in which the entities are compared (the endpoint) - from direct comparative sentences in full-text articles. The system does not require a user to predefine entities in advance and thus can be used in domains where entity recognition is difficult or unavailable. As with a systematic review, the tabular summary produced using the automatically extracted facets shows how experimental results differ between studies. Experiments were conducted using a collection of more than 2million sentences from three journals Diabetes, Carcinogenesis and Endocrinology and two machine learning algorithms, support vector machines (SVM) and a general linear model (GLM). F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and accuracy measures for the SVM and GLM differed by only 0.01 across all three comparison facets in a randomly selected set of test sentences. The system achieved the best performance of 92{\%} for objects, whereas the accuracy for both agent and endpoints was 73{\%}. F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} scores were higher for objects (0.77) than for endpoints (0.51) or agents (0.47). A situated evaluation of Metformin, a drug to treat diabetes, showed system accuracy of 95{\%}, 83{\%} and 79{\%} for the object, endpoint and agent respectively. The situated evaluation had higher F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} scores of 0.88, 0.64 and 0.62 for object, endpoint, and agent respectively. On average, only 5.31{\%} of the sentences in a full-text article are direct comparisons, but the tabular summaries suggest that these sentences provide a rich source of currently underutilized information that can be used to accelerate the systematic review process and identify gaps where future research should be focused.},

abstract = {Objective: The occurrence of pain accounts for billions of dollars in annual medical expenditures; loss of quality of life and decreased worker productivity contribute to indirect costs. As pain is highly subjective, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can be critical for improving the accuracy of pain assessment and offering better support for clinical decision-making. This review is focused on computer technologies for pain management that allow CDSSs to obtain knowledge from the clinical data produced by either patients or health care professionals. Methods and materials: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases to identify relevant articles focused on computerised systems that constituted CDSSs and include data or results related to pain symptoms from patients with acute or chronic pain, published between 1992 and 2011 in the English language. In total, thirty-nine studies were analysed; thirty-two were selected from 1245 citations, and seven were obtained from reference tracking. Results: The results highlighted the following clusters of computer technologies: rule-based algorithms, artificial neural networks, nonstandard set theory, and statistical learning algorithms. In addition, several methodologies were found for content processing such as terminologies, questionnaires, and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53{\%} to 87.5{\%}. Conclusions: Computer technologies that have been applied in CDSSs are important but not determinant in improving the systems' accuracy and the clinical practice, as evidenced by the moderate correlation among the studies. However, these systems play an important role in the design of computerised systems oriented to a patient's symptoms as is required for pain management. Several limitations related to CDSSs were observed: the lack of integration with mobile devices, the reduced use of web-based interfaces, and scarce capabilities for data to be inserted by patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We tackle the problem of automatically filtering studies while preparing Sys-tematic Reviews (SRs) which normally entails manually inspecting thousands of studies to identify the few to be included. The problem is modeled as an imbalanced data classification task where the cost of misclassifying the minority class is higher than the cost of misclas-sifying the majority class. This work introduces a novel method for representing systematic reviews based not only on lexical features, but also utilizing word clustering and citation features. This novel representation is shown to outperform previously used features in rep-resenting systematic reviews, regardless of the classifier. Our work utilizes a random forest classifier with the novel features to accurately predict included studies with high recall. The parameters of the random forest are automatically configured using heuristics methods thus allowing us to provide a product that is usable in real scenarios. Experiments on a dataset containing 15 systematic reviews that were prepared by health care professionals show that our approach can achieve high recall while helping the SR author save time.},

abstract = {Context Independent validation of published scientific results through study replication is a pre-condition for accepting the validity of such results. In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field. Objective In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility. Methods The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach. Results Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80{\%} of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27{\%} of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available. Conclusions The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in low-cost acquisition technologies have made it more practical to acquire real-world datasets on a large scale. This has lead to a number of computer-based solutions for reassembling, archiving and visualizing cultural heritage artifacts. In this thesis, we combine aspects of these technologies in novel ways and introduce algorithms to improve upon their overall efficiency and robustness. First, we introduce a 2-D acquisition system to address the challenge of acquiring higher resolution color and normal maps for large datasets than those available with 3-D scanning devices. Next, we incorporate our normal maps into a novel multi-cue matching system for reassembling small fragments of artifacts. We then present a non-photorealistic rendering pipeline for illustrating geometrically complex objects using images with multiple channels of information.},

@article{Kontonatsios2017a,
abstract = {Citation screening, an integral process within systematic reviews that identifies citations relevant to the underlying research question, is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. During the screening task, analysts manually assign a label to each citation, to designate whether a citation is eligible for inclusion in the review. Recently, several studies have explored the use of active learning in text classification to reduce the human workload involved in the screening task. However, existing approaches require a significant amount of manually labelled citations for the text classification to achieve a robust performance. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method that identifies relevant citations as early as possible in the screening process by exploiting the pairwise similarities between labelled and unlabelled citations to improve the classification performance without additional manual labelling effort. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that similar citations share the same label (e.g., if one citation should be included, then other similar citations should be included also). To calculate the similarity between labelled and unlabelled citations we investigate two different feature spaces, namely a bag-of-words and a spectral embedding based on the bag-of-words. The semi-supervised method propagates the classification codes of manually labelled citations to neighbouring unlabelled citations in the feature space. The automatically labelled citations are combined with the manually labelled citations to form an augmented training set. For evaluation purposes, we apply our method to reviews from clinical and public health. The results show that our semi-supervised method with label propagation achieves statistically significant improvements over two state-of-the-art active learning approaches across both clinical and public health reviews.},

The three methodologies of univariate differencing, temporal profiling and anomaly analysis were undertaken. Univariate differencing was used to determine overall {\{}NDVI{\}} change between 1982 and 2003. A persistence filter was used to filter out ephemeral changes. The temporal profile analyses were carried out over different meteorological subdivisions to compare changes in {\{}NDVI{\}} with rainfall patterns. In the anomaly analysis, the areas of change were analysed over different land cover categories derived from {\{}IRS‚ÄêWiFS{\}} data. The preliminary results indicate that positive trends in vegetation change occurred over most parts of the country and these changes appear not to be highly correlated with rainfall data, indicating that land cover transformations may be the major driving force behind the changes. The land cover classifications experiencing the greatest increasing {\{}NDVI{\}} were tropical thorn forests and intensive agriculture and the land cover experiencing very slow growth included current jhum, tropical moist deciduous and temperate evergreen forest. Five‚Äêyear moving averages indicate a general increase in {\{}NDVI{\}} from 1986 to 1998 and then declining thereafter. This is a concern in most of the meteorological subdivisions.},

In this paper, the portable input devices based on accelerometers and surface electromyography (EMG) sensors worn on the forearm are presented, and an effective fusion strategy for combination of multi-sensor and multi-channel information is proposed to automatically recognize sign language at the subword classification level. Experimental results on the recognition of 121 frequently used Chinese sign language subwords demonstrate the feasibility of developing SLR system based on the presented portable input devices and that our proposed information fusion method is effective for automatic SLR.

abstract = {Objective: Literature database search is a crucial step in the development of clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews. In the age of information technology, the process of literature search is still conducted manually, therefore it is costly, slow and subject to human errors. In this research, we sought to improve the traditional search approach using innovative query expansion and citation ranking approaches. Methods: We developed a citation retrieval system composed of query expansion and citation ranking methods. The methods are unsupervised and easily integrated over the PubMed search engine. To validate the system, we developed a gold standard consisting of citations that were systematically searched and screened to support the development of cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines. The expansion and ranking methods were evaluated separately and compared with baseline approaches. Results: Compared with the baseline PubMed expansion, the query expansion algorithm improved recall (80.2{\%} vs. 51.5{\%}) with small loss on precision (0.4{\%} vs. 0.6{\%}). The algorithm could find all citations used to support a larger number of guideline recommendations than the baseline approach (64.5{\%} vs. 37.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). In addition, the citation ranking approach performed better than PubMed's "most recent" ranking (average precision +6.5{\%}, recall at k +21.1{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), PubMed's rank by "relevance" (average precision +6.1{\%}, recall at k +14.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), and the machine learning classifier that identifies scientifically sound studies from MEDLINE citations (average precision +4.9{\%}, recall at k +4.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: Our unsupervised query expansion and ranking techniques are more flexible and effective than PubMed's default search engine behavior and the machine learning classifier. Automated citation finding is promising to augment the traditional literature search.},

abstract = {Context: Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system. In order to improve estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based SDEE models (ML models) since 1990s. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Objective: This research aims to systematically analyze ML models from four aspects: type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context. Method: We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ML model published in the last two decades (1991-2010). Results: We have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research. After investigating these studies, we found that eight types of ML techniques have been employed in SDEE models. Overall speaking, the estimation accuracy of these ML models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non-ML models. Furthermore, different ML models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts. Conclusion: ML models are promising in the field of SDEE. However, the application of ML models in industry is still limited, so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ML models. To this end, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Recurrence is an important cornerstone in breast cancer behavior, intrinsically related to mortality. In spite of its relevance, it is rarely recorded in the majority of breast cancer datasets, which makes research in its prediction more difficult. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques applied to the prediction of breast cancer recurrence. Material and Methods: Revision of published works that used machine learning techniques in local and open source databases between 1997 and 2014. Results: The revision showed that it is difficult to obtain a representative dataset for breast cancer recurrence and there is no consensus on the best set of predictors for this disease. High accuracy results are often achieved, yet compromising sensitivity. The missing data and class imbalance problems are rarely addressed and most often the chosen performance metrics are inappropriate for the context. Discussion and Conclusions: Although different techniques have been used, prediction of breast cancer recurrence is still an open problem.

A seed set of 901 articles published between 1973 and 2015 was evaluated and in total 65 studies were considered for further analyses. Data extraction and synthesis was performed through content analysis using the PRISMA method. Three thematic categories were identified in regard to music information needs: (a) those related to scholarly activities, (b) musically motivated, as well as (c) those which are related to socializing and communication. In addition, 3 categories of music information sources were connected to musical creativity: (i) those that are related to Internet and media technologies, (ii) those that are related to music libraries, organizations, and music stores, and (iii) those that are related to the subjects' social settings. The paper provides a systematic review, with the aim of showcasing the effect of modern information retrieval techniques in a creative and intensive area of information-dependent activity such as music making and consumption.},

abstract = {Ambiguity in natural language requirements has long been recognized as an inevitable challenge in requirements engineering (RE). Various initiatives have been taken by RE researchers to address the challenges of ambiguity. In this paper the results of a mapping study are presented that focus on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for addressing ambiguity in requirements. Systematic review of the literature resulted in 174 studies on the subject published during 1995 to 2015, and out of these only 28 are empirically evaluated studies that were selected. From of the resulting set of papers, 81{\%} have focused on detecting ambiguity; whereas 4{\%} and 5{\%} are focusing on reducing and removing ambiguity respectively. Addressing syntactic, semantic, and lexical ambiguities has attracted more attention than other types. In spite of all the research efforts, there is a lack of empirical evaluation of NLP tools and techniques for addressing ambiguity in requirements. The results have pointed out some gaps in empirical results and have raised questions the designing of an analytical framework for research in this field. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

@phdthesis{Shivam:2007:PEL:1368545,
abstract = {The overall behavior of a system depends on a large number of factors related to the underlying hardware, system software, and running applications. In addition, system behavior may be influenced by interactions among these factors, where the impact of an individual factor on a system depends on the settings of other factors. A 'system knowledge base' that captures how different factors and multifactor interactions affect the end-to-end behavior of a system is a prerequisite for managing systems effectively. This dissertation addresses the hypothesis that we can learn such a knowledge base in an automatic, proactive, and timely manner by planning and conducting experiments. An experiment is a run of the system for a specific setting of the system's workload, resource allocation, and configuration. In this dissertation, we develop a general experiment-driven framework that incorporates: (a) policies for automatic planning of experiments to explore a large space of factors and interactions efficiently; and (b) mechanisms to conduct experiments for three important system domains: Web services, batch computing, and storage servers. The policies and mechanisms leverage techniques from design of experiments, active machine learning, and system virtualization to build a sufficiently accurate system knowledge base quickly. The dissertation makes the following contributions: (1) Quantifies the linear and nonlinear impact of a factor or an interaction on system behavior, and develops experiment-planning algorithms to estimate the impact of important factors and interactions in a system. We use this work to rank the factors and interactions that can affect the performance (e.g., throughput) of multitier Web services. (2) Develops experiment-planning algorithms to build models that predict the system behavior as a function of factors and interactions that affect this behavior. We explore a continuum of modeling alternatives ranging from a priori models to black-box models. We learn models to enable task and data placement of batch computing applications, and to predict performance measures of Web services like response time and throughput. (3) Develops policies to determine how long to run an experiment and how many times to repeat an experiment to attain target levels of confidence and accuracy in experimental results at low cost. We use the policies to benchmark storage servers by systematically mapping a storage server's saturation throughput across a range of server workloads and configurations. Our empirical evaluation with real and synthetic applications on physical as well as virtual hardware resources shows that our experiment-driven framework can learn an effective knowledge base by conducting only 1-5{\%} of the total number of possible experiments.},

abstract = {Imagine a physician and a patient doing a search on antibiotic resistance. Or a chess amateur and a grandmaster conducting a search on Alekhine's Defence. Although the topic is the same, arguably the two users in each case will satisfy their information needs with very different texts. Yet today search engines mostly adopt the one-size-fits-all solution, where personalization is restricted to topical preference. We found that users do not uniformly prefer simple texts, and that the text comprehensibility level should match the user's level of preparedness. Consequently, we propose to model the comprehensibility of texts as well as the users' reading proficiency in order to better explain how different users choose content for further exploration. We also model topic-specific reading proficiency, which allows us to better explain why a physician might choose to read sophisticated medical articles yet simple descriptions of SLR cameras. We explore different ways to build user profiles, and use collaborative filtering techniques to overcome data sparsity. We conducted experiments on large-scale datasets from a major Web search engine and a community question answering forum. Our findings confirm that explicitly modeling text comprehensibility can significantly improve content ranking (search results or answers, respectively).},

abstract = {Affect detection is an important pattern recognition problem that has inspired researchers from several areas. The field is in need of a systematic review due to the recent influx of Multimodal (MM) affect detection systems that differ in several respects and sometimes yield incompatible results. This article provides such a survey via a quantitative review and meta-analysis of 90 peer-reviewed MM systems. The review indicated that the state of the art mainly consists of person-dependent models (62.2{\%} of systems) that fuse audio and visual (55.6{\%}) information to detect acted (52.2{\%}) expressions of basic emotions and simple dimensions of arousal and valence (64.5{\%}) with feature- (38.9{\%}) and decision-level (35.6{\%}) fusion techniques. However, there were also person-independent systems that considered additional modalities to detect nonbasic emotions and complex dimensions using model-level fusion techniques. The meta-analysis revealed that MM systems were consistently (85{\%} of systems) more accurate than their best unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 9.83{\%} (median of 6.60{\%}). However, improvements were three times lower when systems were trained on natural (4.59{\%}) versus acted data (12.7{\%}). Importantly, MM accuracy could be accurately predicted (cross-validated R2 of 0.803) from unimodal accuracies and two system-level factors. Theoretical and applied implications and recommendations are discussed.},

@article{Mergel2015,
abstract = {Despite the increasing popularity of systematic literature reviews in Software Engineering, several researchers still indicate it as a costly and challenging process. Aiming at alleviating this costly process, we propose an iterative method to support the process of building the search string for a systematic review. This method uses Visual Text Mining techniques to support the researcher by suggesting new terms for the string. In order to do so, the method extracts relevant terms from studies selected by the researcher and displays them in a way that facilitate their visualization and supports building and refining the search string. In order to check the feasibility of this approach, we developed a tool that implements the proposed method. Interviews with researchers identified their difficulties in performing systematic reviews and captured their feedback with regards the use of the proposed method in a user study. The researchers indicated that this approach could be used to improve the process of building the search strings for systematic reviews. The study indicates that our approach can be used to facilitate the construction of the systematic literature review search string. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract = {Healthcare information professionals perform systematic literature reviews to gather the evidence needed to answer specific research questions and formulate policy. However, performing a systematic review is a resource-intensive and time consuming undertaking, often taking years to complete. Moreover, the output relies heavily on the quality of the initial search strategy in ensuring that the scope is sufficiently exhaustive and not biased by easily accessible studies. In this paper we introduce a structured methodology and a framework for learning which together aim to embody best practices from the community and provide support for many of the common issues in search strategy development.},
