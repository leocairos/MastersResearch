mining and recommending software features across multiple web repositories the internetware paradigm is fundamentally changing the traditional way of software development more and more software projects are developed maintained and shared on the internet however a large quantity of heterogeneous software resources have not been organized in a reasonable and efficient way software feature is an ideal material to characterize software resources the effectiveness of feature related tasks will be greatly improved if a multi grained feature repository is available in this paper we propose a novel approach for organizing analyzing and recommend ing software features firstly we construct a hierarchical repository of software feature hesa then we mine the hidden affnities among the features and recommend relevant and high quality features to stakeholders based on hesa finally we conduct a user study to evaluate our approach quantitatively the results show that hesa can organize software features in a more reasonable way compared to the traditional and the state of the art approaches the result of feature recommendation is effective and interesting categories and subject descriptors d

paradigm where software developers usually need to interact with unknown partners as well as the software entities developed by them to reduce uncertainty and boost collaborations in such setting it is important to provide trustworthiness evaluation mechanisms so that trustworthy partners entities can be easily found in this work we propose a novel trustworthiness evaluation mechanism by enhancing existing mechanisms with similarity and non negative constraints to be specific we first extend an existing multi aspect trust inference model by incorporating the non negative constraint one of the advantages of such constraint is its strong interpretability second we incorporate similarity into two neighborhood models borrowed from recommender systems when computing similarity we make use of the intermediate results from the first step finally these models are combined under a machine learning framework to show the effectiveness of our method we conduct experiments on a real data set the results show that both our non negativity extension and similarity computation improve the evaluation accuracy of the original methods and the combined method outperforms several state of the art methods internetware multi aspect non negativity similarity trustworthiness evaluation distributed software development experience and recommendation this paper is based on a distributed software development course project conducted over a period of four months fall 2012 the aim of the project was to develop a classroom face recognition system cfrs to enable instructors automatically to record student attendance this project was a collaborative effort between students and faculties from iowa state university united states of america jilin university republic of china and king mongkut s university of technology thailand we make observations from a project management point of view of distributed software development on the benefits and disadvantages of a variety of issues associated with distributed software development such as of 24 hour work cycle and expanded pool of workforce we highlight the main constraints assumptions challenges and their corresponding mitigation strategies and recommend improvements for future educational distributed projects 2013 ieee classroom face recognition system distributed software development project management simulation analysis of performance of compass and its augmentation system software is compiled to simulate compass constellation with 12 satellites and gps constellation based on 18 stations of the asia pacific region satellite visibility dilution of precision dop and constellation availability of compass and integrated compass gps are calculated and analyzed in detail simulation results reveal that the constellation performances such as satellite visibility dop and availability of compass are good under the low mask angle such as 10 degrees but the performances have a trend of becoming bad with the increase of mask angle under the condition the augmentation of compass by gps is recommended simulation results reveal that the constellation performances will be improved greatly under the high mask angle especially in the middle high latitudes 2013 ieee availability compass dilution of precision gps sumilation visibility a context aware matrix factorization recommender algorithm latent factor models based on matrix tensor factorization techniques are widely recognized in recommender systems however matrix tensor factorization techniques are computationally intensive which greatly limits their usages in real world projects to address this problem we improve the classic matrix factorization models by establishing fuzzy mapping relationships between contexts and latent factors and making use of contextual information to initialize user item feature vectors experimental results on standard test set movielens 1m show that the proposed algorithms could achieve far better prediction accuracy while reducing the iteration number by 25 2013 ieee context latent factor matrix tensor factorization recommender system a distributed anonymization scheme for privacy preserving recommendation systems recommendation systems need to collect user personal data for predicting user preferences the privacy of user personal data becomes a main concern when users are served by the recommendation system in this paper we study the problem of privacy preserving recommendation in the case that the user data are locally stored in a distributed manner we present a distributed anonymization scheme based on the proposed anonymization map the proposed scheme allows users individually anonymize their own data without accessing each other s data the experiment results show that the proposed scheme can preserve the privacy of collaborative users and outperform the perturbation based scheme 2013 ieee anonymization privacy recommendation systems application of aaa security management in classified network in classified information system network security is often described as the cornerstone and network components such as routers and switches are central assets however security management is usually based on ios command only which may cause the loss of network assurance this article described the application of aaa security management in certain classified information network environment to evaluate the enhancement the security protection we compared the meet of standard for protection of state secrets account security log security operation and audit facilitation by a designed prospective randomized and compared study the results showed that the aaa group was in accordance with standard for protection of state secrets meanwhile aaa security management could provide safer account more traceable log and less time consuming operation and audit based on the results we strongly recommended that aaa security management should be widely applied to classified network 2013 ieee aaa acs classified network security clustering collaborative filtering recommendation system based on svd algorithm the most important responsibility for every recommendation system is how to make the appropriate personalized recommendation for different customers rapidly and effectively collaborative filtering recommendation is one of the most popular methods among the e commerce system but it still remains some problems such as cold start and data sparse at the same time more and more users registering on make the real time and expansibility of a system hard to be kept in the paper according to a series of problems such as data sparse and bad real time caused by a large number of registering users we propose a new approach combining the clustering algorithm with svd algorithm which is widely used in the domain of image processing into collaborative filtering algorithm firstly we classify the users by using the attributes of them then we decompose the rating matrix with the svd algorithm and reunion them into new rating matrix to calculate the similarity between each pair of users at last we take advantage of the similarity to find the nearest neighbors in the collaborative filtering recommendation and predict the ratings of the items to make the recommendation our experiments show that the approach cannot only improve the cold start and data sparse problems but also increase the efficiency and scalability of a system 2013 ieee clustering collaborative filtering e commerce svd discovering stakeholders interests in wiki based architectural documentation the software architecture document sad is an important artifact in the early stages of software development as it serves to share and discuss key design and quality attribute concerns among the stakeholders of the project nowadays architectural documentation is commonly hosted in wikis in order to favor communication and interactions among stakeholders however the sad is still a large and complex document in which stakeholders often have difficulties in finding information that is relevant to their interests or daily tasks we argue that the discovery of stakeholders interests is helpful to tackle this information overload problem because a recommendation tool can leverage on those interests to provide each stakeholder with sad sections that match his her profile in this work we propose an approach to infer stakeholders interests based on applying a combination of natural language processing and user profiling techniques the interests are partially inferred by monitoring the stakeholders behavior as they browse a wiki based sad a preliminary evaluation of our approach has shown its potential for making recommendations to stakeholders with different profiles and support them in architectural tasks architectural documentation software architecture stakeholders text mining user profiling wikis synthesizing a comprehensive framework for lean software development lean principles originating from japanese automotive industry are anticipated to be useful to improve software development processes albeit its popularity there is still no generally accepted clear and detailed definition of what lean software development actually means this makes it difficult to perform research on the effects of lean software development and determine its usefulness in various contexts to fill in that research gap this paper analyzes the state of the art based on twenty key lean concepts derived from nine seminal sources identified in a systematic literature review the original explanations of the key concepts have been elaborated further and synthesized into a framework for lean software development consisting of a set of goals recommended activities and practices the detailed results for the key concept value are reported the proposed framework is expected to serve as a basis for further research and for lean assessment of organizations 2013 ieee lean software development software process improvement state of the art systematic literature review objective measurement of safety in the context of iec 61508 3 safety standards like the iec 61508 are an important source for developing safety critical software systems as they provide a set of requirements and recommendations to assist engineers in system and software development applying this standard in practice leads to interpretation problems due to insufficient operationalization i e unclear requirements and unclear or missing acceptance criteria this makes it hard to measure the extent to which a product fulfills the requirements of the standard for this we systematically developed a quality model that covers the coding related parts of the safety standard iec 61508 it provides refinements to the recommendations and equips them with proper measurement support by means of static code analysis tools 236 measures for c c systems we found in an evaluation study that the used approach is suitable for covering the coding related parts of the standard with proper and meaningful operationalization additionally the results indicate an adequate completeness of the modeled contents this encourages us to go a step further and to extend the model to support compliance assessments in future work 2013 ieee iec 61508 quality measurement safety software quality model recommendations to the adoption of new software practices a case study of team intention and behavior in three software companies it is believed that people consider the implications of their actions and act based on a reasonable assessment of those implications in this context belief can be defined as a state of mind that embodies trust and confidence in something so behavior is driven by what is believed by what is culturally assumed to be true about the world our work aims to study and characterize a belief system of software project teams to understand the beliefs underlying an intention or practice and seek answers about how people progress from intention to behavior in software engineering environments we applied a behavioral theory in terms of organizational and team level factors associated to beliefs about the software development practices a set of interviews on origins sources and impacts of beliefs on software practices was conducted with professionals from different project teams and companies the results point out a strong influence of past experiences and repeated behavior on software development practices of project teams also we list a set of practical recommendations for software companies that are dealing with the challenges of adopting new practices on software projects 2013 ieee attitude behavior belief system

most significant areas of research and practice in software engineering it has been shown that getting architecture of large scale complex systems right is not only extremely important but hugely challenging the increasing popularity and adoption of agile software development asd methods have brought architecture centric methods and practices into question as agile followers tend to perceive architecture in the context of plan driven software development it is widely recognized that sa needs sufficient attention for successful development and evolution of software intensive systems and services irrespective of the software development paradigm given the nature of the discipline sa methods and approaches tend to be effort intensive and heavyweight for certain kinds of projects there is an increasing interest in finding ways to apply architecture centric principles and practices in an agile fashion agile architecting a good understanding of architectural principles and approaches is a prerequisite to agile architecting the aim of this chapter is to briefly describe the fundamental concepts principles and practices of architecture centric approaches these concepts principles and practices are expected to provide a reader with sufficient understanding of different aspects of sa and its related methods to combine them with asd methods we start with a brief discussion of the points that make architecture and agile approaches seemingly incompatible then we present and discuss some of the key aspects of architecture centric approaches and techniques that need to be considered for use in asd projects we also provide an overview of some of the key practices that have been recommended for successfully integrating architecture centric approaches in asd for

in the health care system in ethiopia reducing the gap between security audit and software engineering methods the information security aspect has become a major concern for software project leaders the problem is that software engineers still consider security issues as add on requirements expressed and verified by external actors like auditors or security managers we aim to help software engineers by identifying precisely what they are expected to do and to deliver at each step in order to enhance the security level of the targeted information system in this paper we focus on merging security issues in software life cycle therefore we extract security requirements and best practices from security audit methods and embed them in software methods we consider in particular the well known up and mehari methods the idea is to anchor security recommendations from the mehari method in the lifecycle of the up by the mean of meta modeling approach 2013 the science and information organization anchor mapping mde mehari method mapping security audit software engenniring unified process natural language based software analyses and tools for software maintenance significant portions of software life cycle resources are devoted to program maintenance which motivates the development of automated techniques and tools to support the tedious error prone tasks natural language clues from programmers naming in literals identifiers and comments can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of many software tools for example they can be used to increase the accuracy of software search tools improve the ability of program navigation tools to recommend related methods and raise the accuracy of other program analyses by providing access to natural language information this chapter focuses on how to capture model and apply the programmers conceptual knowledge expressed in both linguistic information as well as programming language structure and semantics we call this kind of analysis natural language program analysis nlpa since it combines natural language processing techniques with program analysis to extract information for analysis of the source program springer verlag 2013 natural language program analysis software engineering tools software maintenance investigating confidence displays for top n recommendations recommendation systems often compute fixed length lists of recommended items to users forcing the system to predict a fixed length list for each user may result in different confidence levels for the computed recommendations reporting the system s confidence in its predictions the recommendation strength can provide valuable information to users in making their decisions in this article we investigate several different displays of a system s confidence to users and conclude that some displays are easier to understand and are favored by most users we continue to investigate the effect confidence has on users in terms of their perception of the recommendation quality and the user experience with the system our studies show that it is not easier for users to identify relevant items when confidence is displayed still users appreciate the displays and trust them when the relevance of items is difficult to establish 2013 asis t automatic recommendation of api methods from feature requests developers often receive many feature requests to implement these features developers can leverage various methods from third party libraries in this work we propose an automated approach that takes as input a textual description of a feature request it then recommends methods in library apis that developers can use to implement the feature our recommendation approach learns from records of other changes made to software systems and compares the textual description of the requested feature with the textual descriptions of various api methods we have evaluated our approach on more than 500 feature requests of axis2 java cxf hadoop common hbase and struts 2 our experiments show that our approach is able to recommend the right methods from 10 libraries with an average recall rate 5 of 0 690 and recall rate 10 of 0 779 respectively we also show that the state of the art approach by chan et al that recommends api methods based on precise text phrases is unable to handle feature requests 2013 ieee an analysis of unit tests of a flight software product line this paper presents an analysis of the unit testing approach developed and used by the core flight software system cfs product line team at the nasa goddard space flight center gsfc the goal of the analysis is to understand review and recommend strategies for improving the cfs existing unit testing infrastructure as well as to capture lessons learned and best practices that can be used by other software product line spl teams for their unit testing the results of the analysis show that the core and application modules of the cfs are unit tested in isolation using a stub framework developed by the cfs team the application developers can unit test their code without waiting for the core modules to be completed and vice versa the analysis found that this unit testing approach incorporates many practical and useful solutions such as allowing for unit testing without requiring hardware and special os features in the loop by defining stub implementations of dependent modules these solutions are worth considering when deciding how to design the testing architecture for a spl 2012 elsevier b v all rights reserved flight software metrics self testable components software architecture stub unit testing sharing clinical decisions for multimorbidity case management using social network and open source tools introductionsocial networks applied through web 2 0 tools have gained importance in health domain because they produce improvements on the communication and coordination capabilities among health professionals this is highly relevant for multimorbidity patients care because there is a large number of health professionals in charge of patient care and this requires to obtain clinical consensus in their decisions our objective is to develop a tool for collaborative work among health professionals for multimorbidity patient care we describe the architecture to incorporate decision support functionalities in a social network tool to enable the adoption of shared decisions among health professionals from different care levels as part of the first stage of the project this paper describes the results obtained in a pilot study about acceptance and use of the social network component in our healthcare setting methodsat virgen del rocío university hospital we have designed and developed the shared care platform scp to provide support in the continuity of care for multimorbidity patients the scp has two consecutively developed components social network component called clinical wall and clinical decision support cds system the clinical wall contains a record where health professionals are able to debate and define shared decisions we conducted a pilot study to assess the use and acceptance of the scp by healthcare professionals through questionnaire based on the theory of the technology acceptance model resultsin march 2012 we released and deployed the scp but only with the social network component the pilot project lasted 6 months in the hospital and 2 primary care centers from march to september 2012 we created 16 records in the clinical wall all with a high priority a total of 10 professionals took part in the exchange of messages 3 internists and 7 general practitioners generated 33 messages 12 of the 16 record 75 were answered by the destination health professionals the professionals valued positively all the items in the questionnaire as part of the scp opensource tools for cds will be incorporated to provide recommendations for medication and problem interactions as well as to calculate indexes or scales from validated questionnaires they will receive the patient summary information provided by the regional electronic health record system through a web service with the information defined according to the virtual medical record specification conclusionsclinical wall has been developed to allow communication and coordination between the healthcare professionals involved in multimorbidity patient care agreed decisions were about coordination for appointment changing patient conditions diagnosis tests and prescription changes and renewal the application of interoperability standards and open source software can bridge the gap between knowledge and clinical practice while enabling interoperability and scalability open source with the social network encourages adoption and facilitates collaboration although the results obtained for use indicators are still not as high as it was expected based on the promising results obtained in the acceptance questionnaire of smp we expect that the new cds tools will increase the use by the health professionals 2013 elsevier inc case management clinical decision support systems multimorbidity patient social network technology acceptance model statistical analysis of the implementation for best practices in software development organizations the software industry is formed by 90 of small and medium organizations formally reported to government agencies the needs of such organizations worldwide are particular and are far from the needs of large organizations large organizations are capable of supporting and implementing large and complex structures of international standards and models for software process improvement the provision of facilities to small and medium sized organizations to implement best practices in software development based on the recommendations of the international standards and models is a a need for these organizations b a duty of both industry and academia therefore it is necessary to make a diagnosis to identify the needs of these organizations in the area of best practices in software development the goal of this paper is to analyze the current state of the implementation of best practices in software development in small and medium organizations to achieve this goal a survey was designed then it was applied to a representative region of colombia medellín in this paper we present the analysis of the collected statistical results allowing a pilot study given the target population latin america 2013 aisti best practices diagnosis quality management requirements management risk management recommending software architecture for customized learning management system in this work we have studied the learning management systems lmss and proposed a reference model serving to both analysis and synthesis of lmss such model has been implemented and evaluated being composed of two representations and facilities specially oriented to two important actors in lms development these actors are the author and the developer where a concept map is offered to the first one in order to help authors to select services that will compose the intended lms the flexible reference architecture is dedicated to the software developers in order to help them to implement the user s requirements in this paper we propose a knowledge based recommender system to automatically approximate these two representations through rules that map the needs of the author in design decisions to developers hence the system may recommend a new architecture for customized lms or even an existing lms to the author the proposed system has been evaluated in the task of constructing a specific lms thus showing positive results 2013 aisti lms and reference model recommender system software project management in small and very small entities project management is a discipline with an established and consolidated body of

ontology evaluation across the life cycle the ontology summit 2013 problem currently there is no agreed on methodology for development of ontologies and there is no consensus on how ontologies should be evaluated consequently evaluation techniques and tools are not widely utilized in the development of ontologies this can lead to ontologies of poor quality and is an obstacle to the successful deployment of ontologies as a technology approach the goal of the ontology summit 2013 was to create guidance for ontology developers and users on how to evaluate ontologies over a period of four months a variety of approaches were discussed by participants who represented a broad spectrum of ontology software and system developers and users we explored how established best practices in systems engineering and in software engineering can be utilized in ontology development results this document focuses on the evaluation of five aspects of the quality of ontologies intelligibility fidelity craftsmanship fitness and deployability a model for the ontology life cycle is presented andevaluation criteria are presented in the context of the phases of the life cycle we disc uss the availability of tools and the document ends with observations and recommendations given the current level of maturity of ontology as an engineering discipline any results on how to best build and evaluate ontologies have to be considered as preliminary however the results achieved a broad consensus across the range of backgrounds application foci specialties and experience found in the ontology summit community recommendations for more reliable success in ontology development and use ontology evaluation should be incorporated across all phases of the ontology life cycle evaluation should be conducted against carefully identified requirements these requirements depend on the intended use of the ontology and its operational environment for this reason we recommend the development of integrated ontology development and management environments that support the tracking of requirements for and the evaluation of ontologiesacross all phases of their development and use 2013 ios

performance computing infrastructure the production level operation of the high performance computing infrastructure hpci has been started from the end of september 2012 hpci is a distributed supercomputing infrastructure in japan currently ten supercomputer sites including the k computer and two high performance shared storage sites organize hpci the national institute of informatics nii is in charge of operation of the authentication system which enables single sign on the supercomputers and the shared storages in hpci using the grid security infrastructure gsi nii operates the certificate authority in the authentication system recently the internet community strongly recommends using the sha 2 family as hash algorithm for digital signature in the grid community the international grid trust federation igtf also has discussed sha 2 migration then requests the accredited certificate authorities to issue sha 2 based certificates from the autumn of 2013 however we do not have sufficient experiences based on practical experiments in nation wide grid computing infrastructure such as hpci in this paper we present design and implementation of the certificate authority for hpci hpci ca hpci ca follows the cp cps based on the member integrated x 509 credential services mics profile and it issues sha 256 based certificates for ca itself and all end entities in gsi first we present an overview of the authentication system in hpci and the design of the certificate authority then we discuss the issues for supporting sha 2 based certificates in implementation of the authentication system focusing on two middleware the software to build pki domain naregi ca and the gsi enabled ssh client software gsi sshterm naregica is an open source software for easily building pki domain we mention the development of naregi ca for handling the sha 2 family as for gsi sshterm the ncsa version that supports jglobus 2 is adopted finally we discuss the problems recognized after the start of production level operation of hpci for instance we illustrate how the problem that the cryptographic handshake between gsi sshterm and gsi enabled ssh server fails under a certain condition is resolved we also briefly present a plan for supporting the online certificate status protocol ocsp responder and ipv6 capable end points which are used for publishing the

information sciences education kenya lis education undergraduate lis students handling missing attributes using matrix factorization predictive models that use machine learning techniques has been useful tools to guide software project managers in making decisions under uncertainty however in practice collecting metrics or defect data has been a troublesome job and researchers often have to deal with incomplete datasets in their studies as a result both researchers and practitioners shy away from implementing such models missing data is a common problem in other domains to build recommender systems we believe that the techniques used to overcome missing data problem in other domains can also be employed in software engineering in this paper we propose matrix factorization algorithm to tackle with missing data problem in building predictive models in software development domain 2013 ieee matrix factorization missing data software defect prediction a support system for helping to understand a project in software maintenance using the program package name under the global competition of business software development is required to be conducted more efficiently in particular software maintenance holds the majority in the costs of software development developers must understand a project to conduct software maintenance efficiently therefore this study develops a support system for understanding a project in software maintenance this study proposes to use the program package name to utilize function name as the program package name is required by using the name the system extracts associations with parts of functional specification furthermore based on the cosine similarity using the vector space model between design documents or communication messages and the parts extracted by the program package name related artifacts are recommended by the system 2013 ieee program package name recommendation system software maintenance automatic query reformulations for text retrieval in software engineering there are more than twenty distinct software engineering tasks addressed with text retrieval tr techniques such as traceability link recovery feature location refactoring reuse etc a common issue with all tr applications is that the results of the retrieval depend largely on the quality of the query when a query performs poorly it has to be reformulated and this is a difficult task for someone who had trouble writing a good query in the first place we propose a recommender called refoqus based on machine learning which is trained with a sample of queries and relevant results then for a given query it automatically recommends a reformulation strategy that should improve its performance based on the properties of the query we evaluated refoqus empirically against four baseline approaches that are used in natural language document retrieval the data used for the evaluation corresponds to changes from five open source systems in java and c and it is used in the context of tr based concept location in source code refoqus outperformed the baselines and its recommendations lead to query performance improvement or preservation in 84 of the cases in average 2013 ieee query reformulation text retrieval 1 sup st sup international workshop on assurance cases for software intensive systems assure 2013 software plays a key role in high

software engineering expectations outcomes and challenges of modern code review code review is a common software engineering practice employed both in open source and industrial contexts review today is less formal and more lightweight than the code inspections performed and studied in the 70s and 80s we empirically explore the motivations challenges and outcomes of tool based code reviews we observed interviewed and surveyed developers and managers and manually classified hundreds of review comments across diverse teams at microsoft our study reveals that while finding defects remains the main motivation for review reviews are less about defects than expected and instead provide additional benefits such as knowledge transfer increased team awareness and creation of alternative solutions to problems moreover we find that code and change understanding is the key aspect of code reviewing and that developers employ a wide range of mechanisms to meet their understanding needs most of which are not met by current tools we provide recommendations for practitioners and researchers 2013 ieee identifying failure inducing developer pairs within developer networks software systems have not only become larger over time but the amount of technical contributors and dependencies have also increased with these expansions also comes the increasing risk of introducing a software failure into a pre existing system software failures are a multi billion dollar problem in the industry today and while integration and other forms of testing are helping to ensure a minimal number of failures research to understand full impacts of code changes and their social implications is still a major concern this paper describes how analysis of code changes and the technical relationships they infer can be used to detect pairs of developers whose technical dependencies may induce software failures these developer pairs may also be used to predict future software failures as well as provide recommendations to contributors to solve these failures caused by source code changes 2013 ieee reputation mechanism model research based on the trusted third party recommendation in this paper by analyzing the existing reputation mechanism model and the key entities in the credit system a reputation mechanism model based on the trusted third party recommendation is put forward to deal with the phenomenon of honesty deficiency different from the current passive situation of the query agent understanding the target entity the query agent will ask initiatively its third party recommendation for the reputation value of the target entity in this model which may reduce the malicious deception of the target entity to some extent in addition the model combined the different background factors in the query process the recommended backgrounds and the time decay factors it can make full use of the effective message from the third party recommendation and provide more reliable credibility of the aggregate values 2013 springer verlag calculation of reputation value reputation model third party recommendation trusted tags recommending based on social graph as fast development of social network ugc user generated content has played a very important role in web 2 0 however most of ugc is non structured data which is hard to be used by search engine or user recommending system social mining is the way to make ugc accessible but ugc are trivial noisy sparse causing social mining methods inefficient in this paper we propose a tag recommending approach based on social graph social graphic recommending can reduce mining depending on ugc thus be able to generate high quality tags our most contribution is to combine social graph with lda algorithm to find users latent common interest thus extract tags we did experiment on real data crawled from sina weibo the evaluation showed that our approach archived much better precision and recall than baseline methods 2013 springer verlag lda social graph social mining tags recommendation yoda young and newcomer developer assistant mentoring project newcomers is a crucial activity in software

methods classes fields and other program elements primarily by following naming conventions in software these software naming conventions follow systematic patterns which can convey deep natural language clues that can be leveraged by software engineering tools for example they can be used to increase the accuracy of software search tools improve the ability of program navigation tools to recommend related methods and raise the accuracy of other program analyses after splitting multi word names into their component words the next step to extracting accurate natural language information is tagging each word with its part of speech pos and then chunking the name into natural language phrases state of theart approaches most of which rely on traditional pos taggers trained on natural language documents do not capture the syntactic structure of program elements in this paper we present a pos tagger and syntactic chunker for source code names that takes into account programmers naming conventions to understand the regular systematic ways a program element is named we studied the naming conventions used in object oriented programming and identified different grammatical constructions that characterize a large number of program identifiers this study then informed the design of our pos tagger and chunker our evaluation results show a significant improvement in

small set of important tags for each user to find useful bookmarks to recommend our method is also powerful because it employs the wikipedia category database to deal with the diversity of tags among users the evaluation using the hatena bookmark service in japan shows that our method significantly increases the number of relevant bookmarks recommended without notable increase of irrelevant

prediction models which provide a more focussed allocation of resources toward low quality program modules very often software metrics and defect data sets are biased with respect to class distribution i e the proportion of not fault prone program modules is substantially higher than the proportion of fault prone modules class distribution bias in software defect data leads to poor classification performance data sampling boosting and bagging are useful techniques for alleviating this problem in this study we compare rusboost random undersampling and boosting and rbbag roughly balanced bagging two techniques proposed by our team for handling class distribution bias or class imbalance in binary classification problems rusboost combines data sampling and boosting for alleviating the class imbalance problem while rbbag combines data sampling with bagging for alleviating the class imbalance problem an empirical software engineering case study consisting of 15 software metrics and defect data sets from several realworld software projects is used to investigate the relative effectiveness of rusboost and rbbag for handling software defect data sets with classdistribution bias it is shown that rbbag generally performs better than rusboost in the context of our case study moreover both rusboost and rbbag outperform defect prediction models built without any data sampling boosting or bagging our study recommends considering class distribution bias during the modeling and building of software defect prediction models applying effective methods to alleviate the class distribution bias is an important step in the proper handling of the affected data set thereby reducing the negative effect on the classification performance bagging boosting

online freelance marketplaces how to evaluate a conflict minimizing task scheduler through a user study on planning an evaluation of the impact of identifier names on the readability and quality of smalltalk programs and a proposed recommender system for eliciting software sustainability requirements utilizing software reuse experience for automated test recommendation the development of defect tests is still a very labour intensive process that demands a high level of domain knowledge concentration and problem awareness from software engineers any technology that can reduce the manual effort involved in this process therefore has the potential to significantly reduce software development costs and time consumption an idea for achieving this is to reuse the knowledge bound up in already existing test cases either directly or indirectly to assist in the development of tests for new software components and systems although general software reuse has received a lot of attention in the past both in academia and industry previous research has focussed on the reuse and recommendation of existing software artifacts in the creation of new product code rather than on the recommendation of tests in this paper we focus on the latter and present a novel automated test recommendation approach that leverages lessons learned from traditional software reuse to proactively make test case suggestions while an engineer is developing tests in contrast most existing testing assistance tools provide ex post assistance to test developers in the form of coverage assessments and test quality evaluations our goal is to create an automated non intrusive recommendation system for efficient software test development in this paper we set out the basic strategy by which this can be achieved and present a prototypical implementation of our test recommender system for eclipse 2013 ieee probabilistic topic models for sequence data probabilistic topic models are widely used in different contexts to uncover the hidden structure in large text corpora one of the main and perhaps strong assumption of these models is that generative process follows a bag of words assumption i e each token is independent from the previous one we extend the popular latent dirichlet allocation model by exploiting three different conditional markovian assumptions i the token generation depends on the current topic and on the previous token ii the topic associated with each observation depends on topic associated with the previous one iii the token generation depends on the current and previous topic for each of these modeling assumptions we present a gibbs sampling procedure for parameter estimation experimental evaluation over real word data shows the performance advantages in terms of recall and precision of the sequence modeling approaches 2013 the author s collaborative filtering performance probabilistic topic models recommender systems aggregation of the web performance of internal university units as a method of quantitative analysis of a university system the case of spain the aggregation of web performance data page count and visibility of internal university units could constitute a more precise indicator than the overall web performance of the universities and therefore be of use in the design of university web rankings in order to test this hypothesis a longitudinal analysis of the internal units of the spanish university system was conducted over the course of 2010 for the 13 800 urls identified page count and visibility were calculated using the yahoo api the internal values obtained were aggregated by university and compared with the values obtained from the analysis of the universities general urls the results indicate that although the correlations between general and internal values are high internal performance is low in comparison to general performance and that they give rise to different performance rankings the conclusion is that the aggregation of unit performance is of limited use due to the low levels of internal development of the websites and so its use is not recommended for the design of rankings despite this the internal analysis enabled the detection of among other things a low correlation between page count and visibility due to the widespread use of subdirectories and problems accessing certain content 2013 asis t ranking url webometrics new features in xquery 3 0 xquery 3 0 was published in january 2013 as a w3c candidate recommendation it adds a number of new features to xquery 1 0 which was published as a w3c recommendation in january 2007 and revised in december 2010 the flwor expression is made up of for let where order by and return causes all but the return clause can be thought of as generating ordered streams of tuples each tuple contains one or more bindings of variables to values the group by clause will be familiar to anyone that has used sql tuples are grouped and these groups can be acted upon by subsequent clauses the count clause has been added to the flwor expression to identify the position of tuples in the tuple stream the window clause operates on a sequence and derives zero or more windows from that sequence the xpath and xquery data model has been extended allowing function as a new primitive type this allows functions to return functions and it allows functions to accept functions as arguments non intrusive termination of noisy optimization significant savings can be gained from terminating the optimization of a computationally expensive function well before traditional criteria such as a maximum budget of evaluations are satisfied early termination is desirable especially for noisy functions where a solver could potentially proceed indefinitely while seeing changes insignificant relative to the noise in this paper we consider general termination tests that can be used in conjunction with any solver s built in termination criteria we propose parameterized families of termination tests analyse their properties and illustrate how they can employ an estimate of the function s noise level using a set of benchmark problems with both stochastic and deterministic noise and a set of derivative free solvers we compare the tests and their sensitivities to parameters in terms of both accuracy and efficiency recommendations are made for using the proposed tests in practice 2013 taylor and francis group llc derivative free optimization deterministic noise noisy optimization stochastic noise termination criteria a

at universities the selection of relevant work from among the increasing amount of scientific literature can be problematic the challenge is to find relevant recommendations especially when the related articles are not obviously linked this paper seeks to discuss these issues this paper focuses on the analysis of user activity traces in journals using the open source software open journal the research questions to what extent end users follow a certain link structure given within ojs or immediately select the articles according to their interests in the latter case the recorded data sets are used for creating further recommendations the analysis is based on an article matrix displaying the usage frequency of articles and their user selected successive articles within the ojs furthermore the navigation paths are analysed it was found that the users tend to follow a set navigation structure moreover a hybrid recommendation system for ojs is described which uses content

engineering the indices are taken as not only the basis for the software reliability design and the constraints during the software development process but also the foundation of the software s acceptance software reliability indices are usually divided into quantitative indices and qualitative indices quantitative indices are quantified software reliability parameters values such as software reliability is quantitatively defined as the probability of failure free operation of a software program for a specified time under specified conditions however having a number even with the appropriate accompanying evidence is not generally sufficient to convince customers or even the system software suppliers that the software satisfies its requirements thus qualitative indices such as software reliability is also qualitatively defined as a set of attributes that bear on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under stated conditions for a stated period of time attributes that relate to implementation of fault tolerance design use of best engineering practices application of specialized methods and techniques for ensuring reliability critical requirements and procedural methods to ensure mistake proof loading and or operation also provide evidence that improves the confidence that the software will not cause a system failure so the qualitative indices can be regarded as the requirements for software reliability activities throughout the development process unfortunately currently there is no systematic theory and approach for software reliability indices determination this paper proposes a method for determining the software reliability qualitative indices based on the two standards of sae ja1003 and rtca do 178b which are widely used by the airworthiness and industrial sectors as well as the best practices and management experiences of software reliability engineering this paper proposes the method s principle which determines the software reliability qualitative indices according to the profile formed by all stages of the software life cycle and the environment requirements technique requirements validation requirements and management requirements combined with the software s criticality levels this paper also proposes a generic framework which recommends a variety of tailoring mechanisms and building guidelines to help users develop their demanded indices 2013 ieee indices demonstration indices determination qualitative indices quantitative indice software reliability data quality some comments on

courses of the bachelor of science information systems management degree program bsc ism offered by the school of information systems sis at the singapore management university smu nearly all assessments exercises in class activities and lectures of this selected course enterprise web solutions are centered around one specific case study which has been written specifically for this course the paper reports on the practices implemented in this course to design and deliver all hands on components of the course it discusses the approach used to tie the lecture component of the course to the case study and it briefly discusses the rationale of using a fictitious company for the case study of the course instead of using a real company and real scenario the paper concludes with a series of recommendations to course designers and educators in the computing education field who are involved in the design and delivery of technology centered courses and who are interested in exploring the use of case studies in their courses while the paper is describing best practices implemented within the frame of an information systems program these practices are largely applicable to any other

information systems curriculum an offshore field development plan to optimize the production system from the reservoir to the tank to perform a successful optimization of large and complex production facility there should be a good communication between engineers at different departments reservoir production geological etc however as a common practice their decision making process is separate from each other this may result in under designing such as flow bottlenecks or over designing which imposes unnecessary expenditures this lack of communication can be alleviated by coupling the reservoir flow model to the facility network by means of enhancements in software development that can perform networking analysis in an effective manner this paper presents a work methodology and recommendations through a case study to develop an offshore field that contains both heavy and medium oil first commercial software is utilized to build the model according to the input data subsequently a development plan has been suggested for this field and number of wells to be drilled in the reservoir has been determined then sensitivity analysis is performed to find out the best possible scenario to produce from the field economical analysis is performed for each case to assure profitability according to the available recoverable reserves a 13 year production plan is proposed average of 7 46 per year simulation results indicate that by the proposed scenario at least 20 more of total recoverable reserves can be produced over this period the highest oil rate is observed at the end of fourth year 98000 stb d when the field is mainly developed this case study shows that complex production systems can be modeled by commercial software which leads into better production forecasts in addition it can help us in selecting proper down hole equipments and predicting the possible problems in each well such as sand production or asphaltene deposition in this case copyright

unfortunately animated transitions are usually addressed too late in software development we recommend to consider animated transitions already during user interface ui storyboarding typically ui storyboards do not address the kind of transition they focus on the screens and visualize a transition just with a simple arrow therefore we investigated the leading mobile phone operating systems ios

development is moving in the direction of modeling as do quite a lot of other it related tasks this means models become more and more important either as a means of communication or as parts of realizations unfortunately these models are rarely reused which might be due to poor tool support a model recommender system is one possible way out but it bases on high quality data which is most likely stored in a database and needs to blend into an environment hence approaching model recommendations in a model driven way and generating the underlying data store which makes do with an existing infrastructure is desirable in this paper we describe the underlying model and the obstacles we had to overcome to make this approach work for relational and non relational databases 2013 springer verlag berlin heidelberg eclipse modeling framework emf model library model recommender model reuse multi database a measurement approach for overcoming unbalanced overwork in multi agent systems overworking behaviors appear in multi agent systems specially when there are unbalanced communication patterns this occurs when an agent receives many messages in a short period of time in comparison to other agents as the agent pays attention to the large amount of messages it worsens its performance causing the system s performance to worsen as well while other agents with similar services can be idle the reasons for these behaviors are varied and depend on the nature of the messages this article presents a measurement approach that detects unbalanced overworking situations in multi agent systems with a new metric moreover this approach includes a set of recommendations that determine possible common causes of this defective behavior depending on the relations of different measurement values these recommendations also propose a solution for repairing each cause suppressing these unbalanced overworking situations a tool has been developed for allowing designers to measure the agents communications to obtain the diagnosis and to know the recommended solutions the current work has been applied in two case studies whose results advocate that the suppression of unbalanced overworking situations is strongly related to the improvement of performance in multi agent systems furthermore the experience of this approach in nine different problem domains is presented as support for the causes and solutions of the set of recommendations 2013 world scientific publishing company agent oriented software engineering communication metric multi agent system overwork performance improving logic based testing logic based testers design tests from logical expressions that appear in software artifacts such as source code design models and requirements specifications this paper presents three improvements to logic based test design first in the context of mutation testing we present fault hierarchies for the six relational operators applying the ror mutation operator causes each relational operator to generate seven mutants per clause the fault hierarchies show that only three of these seven mutants are needed second we show how to bring the power of the ror operator to logic based test criteria such as the widely used multiple condition decision coverage mcdc test criterion third we present theoretical results supported by empirical data that show that the more recent coverage criterion of minimal mumcut can find significantly more faults than mcdc the paper has three specific recommendations 1 change the way the ror mutation operator is defined in existing and future mutation systems 2 augment logic based test criteria to incorporate relational operator replacement from mutation 3 replace the use of mcdc with minimal mumcut both

approach and the benefits achieved with its adaptation targeting development of a quality information system a systematic approach for designing educational recommender systems 2014 igi global the construction of educational recommender system ers demands the incorporation of quality attributes at the software design such as availability for preventing the service to be unavailable for a long time and scalability for preventing the system from going offline due to a large number of simultaneous requests the incorporation of such characteristics makes ers more complex and expensive but existing strategies for designing ers do not consider quality attributes in an explicit way this chapter presents an architecture centered solution which is partially supported by tools and considers quality attributes as early as possible in the software development process in a systematic way from requirements to the source code the feasibility of the proposed process is showed in terms of a case study executed in a step by step fashion presenting how the software architecture can be designed and gradually refined until it achieves the level of object oriented classes generated based on design patterns mapping study about usability requirements elicitation the hci community has developed guidelines and recommendations for improving the usability system that are usually applied at the last stages of the software development process on the other hand the se community has developed sound methods to elicit functional requirements in the early stages but usability has been relegated to the last stages together with other non functional requirements therefore there are no methods of usability requirements elicitation to develop software within both communities an example of this problem arises if we focus on the model driven development paradigm where the methods and tools that are used to develop software do not support usability requirements elicitation in order to study the existing publications that deal with usability requirements from the first steps of the software development process this work presents a mapping study our aim is to compare usability requirements methods and to identify the strong points of each one 2013 springer verlag mapping study mdd non functional requirements usability claims and evidence for architecture based self adaptation a systematic literature review engineering the upcoming generation of software systems and guaranteeing the required qualities is complex due to the inherent uncertainties at design time such as new user needs and changing availability of resources architecture based self adaptation is a promising approach to tackle these challenges in this approach a system maintains a model of itself and adapts itself to realize particular quality objectives using a feedback loop despite a vast body of work no systematic study has been performed on the claims associated with architecture based self adaptation and the evidence that exists for these claims as such insight is important for researchers and engineers we performed a systematic literature review covering 20 leading software engineering conferences and journals in the field resulting in 121 studies used for data collection the review shows that self adaptation is primarily used to improve performance reliability and flexibility the tradeoffs implied by self adaptation have not received much attention and evidence is mainly obtained from simple examples from the study we derive a number of recommendations for future research in

description is not consistent with cg methods b spline and nurbs used in cad that is the geometry of cad models is not preserved when these models are converted to a fe mesh for performing the

improving the test quality of safety critical software testing provides a primary means for assuring software in safety critical systems to demonstrate particularly to a certification authority that sufficient testing has been performed it is necessary to achieve the test coverage levels recommended or mandated by safety standards and industry guidelines mutation testing provides an alternative or complementary method of measuring test sufficiency but has not been widely adopted in the safety critical industry in this study we provide an empirical evaluation of the application of mutation testing to airborne software systems which have already satisfied the coverage requirements for certification specifically we apply mutation testing to safety critical software developed using high integrity subsets of c and ada identify the most effective mutant types and analyze the root causes of failures in test cases our findings show how mutation testing could be effective where traditional structural coverage analysis and manual peer review have failed they also show that several testing issues have origins beyond the test activity and this suggests improvements to the requirements definition and coding process our study also examines the relationship between program characteristics and mutation survival and considers how program size can provide a means for targeting test areas most likely to have dormant faults industry feedback is also provided particularly on how mutation testing can be integrated into a typical verification life cycle of airborne

experiment context uml has been the de facto standard notation for modeling object oriented software systems since its appearance in 1997 uml diagrams are important for maintainers of a system especially when the software was developed by a different team these diagrams of the system are not always available however and are commonly recovered using reverse engineering re techniques when obtained through re uml diagrams have a high level of detail as compared to those developed in the forward design activity method in this paper we report on a comparison of the attitude and performance of maintainers when using these two kinds of diagrams during the maintenance of source code our findings were obtained by carrying out a controlled experiment with 40 students of a master s degree in computer science results the results show a preference for forward design diagrams but do not display significant differences in task performance the post experiment survey results have led us to conclude that the subjects did not consider re diagrams helpful they found them difficult to understand particularly the sequence diagrams in the case of forward design diagrams subjects considered sequence diagrams as useful but they did not really employ them conclusions based on our findings as regards performance of maintainers there are no objective results which favor the use of one of these types of diagram in particular i e uml diagrams which come from forwards design on the one hand and diagrams obtained from re on the other subjective opinions do however lead us to recommend the use of diagrams created during design nevertheless we realize that the results should be considered as preliminary ones further replications of this experiment are planned using students

active with the majority of these projects failing firms need a reliable set of criteria to assess what makes a project appealing not only to developers but also to visitors users and commercial sponsors in this paper we develop a theoretical model to explore the contextual and causal factors of project attractiveness in inducing activities such as source code contribution software maintenance and usage we test our model with data derived from more than 4000 projects spanning 4 years our main findings include that projects set of conditions such as license restrictiveness and their available resources provide the context that directly influence the amount of work activities observed in the projects it was also found that indirect and unintended contributions such as recommending software despite of being non technical cannot be ignored for project activeness diffusion and sustainability finally our analysis provide evidence that higher attractiveness leads to more code related activities with the downside of slowing down responsiveness to address projects tasks such as the implementation of new features and bug fixes our model underscores the significance of the reinforcing effects of attractiveness and work activities in open source projects giving us the opportunity to discuss strategies to manage common traps such as the liability of newness we

effective recommendation method for cold start new users using trust and distrust networks recommendation systems analyze the purchasing behavior e g item ratings of users to learn about their preferences and recommend products or services that may be of interest to them however as new users require time to become familiar with recommendation systems the systems usually have limited information about newcomers and have difficulty providing appropriate recommendations this so called new user cold start phenomenon has a serious impact on the performance of recommendation systems as a result there has been increasing research in recent years into new user cold start recommendation methods that try to provide useful item recommendations for cold start new users the rationale behind much of the research is that recommending items to new users generally creates a sense of belonging and loyalty and encourages them to frequently utilize recommendation systems in this paper we propose a cold start recommendation method for the new user that integrates a user model with trust and distrust networks to identify trustworthy users the suggestions of these users are then aggregated to provide useful recommendations for cold start new users experiments based on the well known epinions dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method moreover the method

are cognizant of the fact that most project failures are attributed to poor requirements on the other side there are several recommendations tools methods etc available to overcome the said issues pertaining to requirements despite such recommendations challenges still persist this paper attempts to understand the issues that impact effectiveness and efficiencies of global requirements elicitation through literature reviews and discussions with practitioners this paper proposes a research framework to reflect the state of the art and state of the practice requirement elicitation

requirements engineering discovering and studying collaboration networks in software repositories collaboration is important to software development processes and collaboration networks help us understand its structure and patterns a common problem however is that these networks are not known and need to be discovered in this work we study collaboration networks of five projects using an existing method that mines these networks from version control systems the method is based on recommender system techniques and finds similar developers by analyzing commits that are made to common files these similarities are then used to automatically construct the network and it is visualized using a force directed graph layout algorithm two of the studied projects come from industry and are closed source while the other three are open source in each study we learn some of the project s collaboration form and organization we also were able to find various aspects of these projects that

deployment models in the automotive industry 2013 springer verlag berlin heidelberg many companies in the automotive industry have adopted model driven development in their vehicle software development as a major automotive company general motors gm has been using a custom built domain specific modeling language implemented as an internal proprietary metamodel to meet the modeling needs in its control software development since automotive open system architecture autosar has been developed as a standard to ease the process of integrating components provided by different suppliers and manufacturers there has been a growing demand to migrate these gm specific legacy models to autosar models given that autosar defines its own metamodel for various system artifacts in automotive software development we explore applying model transformations to address the challenges in migrating gm specific legacy models to their autosar equivalents as a case study we have built and validated a model transformation using the mdworkbench tool the atlas transformation language and the metamodel coverage checker tool this paper reports on the case study makes observations based on our experience to assist in the development of similar types of transformations and provides recommendations for further research automotive control software autosar black box testing model

recent advances in freight and commercial vehicle modeling the current state of the practice methods are not adequate to address the increasingly complex issues related to freight demand this project includes research that has combined tour based truck models and logistics supply chain models for urban commercial vehicle movements and that has demonstrated a functional model framework that addresses the limitations of current freight demand forecasting models the research was performed by resource systems group inc in partnership with the chicago metropolitan agency for planning and the university of illinois at chicago the project introduced a model framework and focused on the estimation of each of the model components described the approach to linking the models together in the model application and presented initial results from applying the model in the chicago region the models were estimated for demonstration purposes from several sources since there were no datasets that could support all aspects of the new framework to make the demonstration more practical two commodities were chosen to model from the data available food products and manufactured products the models developed for the project were applied using software developed in r an open source platform a data collection program to support the estimation calibration and forecasting of the framework for

accelerator varian associates palo alto ca usa equipped with millennium 120 multileaf collimator an as1000 portal vision electronic portal imaging device epid was installed on the accelerator in‐house gamma analysis software was designed to compare the dosimetryc distributions predicted by the xio 4 50 treatment planning system elekta stockholm sweden and those measured by the epid system the epid was calibrated in absolute dose following the vendor recommended procedure imrt fields were acquired at a source to detector distance of 105 cm to validate the results of the in‐house software the same imrt fields were also acquired using a commercial 2d array of 445 n‐type diodes system arranged in a 22 cm side cm2 area subdivided in two density regions a central 10 cm side region containing 221 diodes spaced 7 07 mm and an outer region containing 221 diodes spaced 14 14 mm gamma distribution map and percentage of points with gamma 1 using a 3 3mm criterion were used in both cases as qa pass fail criteria results for one given field gamma distribution maps of both detectors were similar in the inner region of the field but epid based images showed more discrepancies in the borders of the fields due to higher resolution of the epid panel percentage of points with gamma 1 was between 97 2 and 99 7 for epid images and between 96 0 and 100 for 2d diode array conclusion the software developed ad hoc for epid based imrt qa proved to be a valuable and affordable solution similar results confirm soundness of the analysis performed by the software and validates its clinical use 2013

integrity requirements defined by the gps directorate to support all classes of gps users signal integrity is the degree of trust that a user of the gps signal can place in the correctness of received signal and associated data these requirements will allow users to define and bound potential hazards in the signal to meet these requirements new space vehicle sv design features and safety analyses have been included as part of gps iii program development these efforts will result in improved signal integrity and a solid foundation for assumptions on basic gps iii satellite performance that are used in the development of user equipment and for ground based augmentation systems gbas and space based augmentation systems sbas that provide additional integrity to users that need it these integrity improvements will provide higher service availability allowing aviation users to conduct more operations in more parts of the world for greater periods of time gps iii design features provided to meet these signal integrity requirements include more robust on board monitoring functions that detect anomalous conditions and rapidly switch the broadcast signal to non standard code nsc to prevent users from tracking a potentially erroneous signal a comprehensive set of analyses in accordance with society of automotive engineers sae aerospace recommended practices arp 4754 have been performed to identify and quantify potential failure conditions that could lead to signal errors in excess of thresholds defined by the gps iii requirements these analyses include functional hazard

cloud computing by businesses despite the user interests and cloud advancements gained recently the key finding is that the it industry has taken different modelling approaches to engineer and deliver the cloud services based on the goals of different key cloud players thereby raising various adoption challenges and concerns in this context there is a need for rethinking software engineering concepts this motivates us to question whether the existing software engineering theories and modelling principles are sufficient for the new cloud computing paradigm due to the paucity of a comprehensive review in literature the main aim of this review article is to identify such research gaps and insufficiencies in software engineering and to provide recommendations for bridging these gaps in this work the systemic review of the state of the art of cloud computing has resulted in identifying four major cloud modelling gaps that require prime attention the paper discusses these gaps and identifies the key software engineering challenges prevalent in addressing each of these gaps finally the author proposes five topmost research recommendations specifically designed for overcoming these gaps challenges in order to facilitate a sustainable cloud adoption overall the author s findings have established the need to rethink software engineering theories for arriving at a multilateral or distributed cloud modelling approach with such rethinking the proposed cloud design automatically incorporates cloud user roles interoperability intelligent automation and trusted

prioritization in software engineering a systematic mapping study in this paper we report about a systematic mapping study in software requirements prioritization with a specific focus on empirical

we report the prevalence of studies on techniques and methodologies while there is a scarce interest in the strict evaluation of tools that could be beneficial to industry in most of the empirical

of software engineering since effectively selecting the fits pattern for a given problem can seriously improve the quality of the software on the contrary of the expert developers selecting the suitable pattern process consider to be critical phase especially for novice developers which have to be provided with mechanism to help them find a suitable pattern to a particular solution this paper introduces a design pattern selection architecture dps based on a multi agent system mas that aim to obtain the appropriate recommendation to reduce development efforts facilitate and assist the developers in selecting the suitable patterns for their problems springer international publishing switzerland 2013 robust design of multi agent system interactions a testing approach based on pattern matching the definition of protocols between agents is not enough for guaranteeing the absence of undesirable communication in organizations and the presence of desirable ones in large multi agent systems mass this is a consequence of the complex system nature of mass which cause sophisticated behaviors to arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions among the independent agents composing them with this motivation this paper presents an approach for testing communication in mas architectures in this approach designers are not only recommended to specify the desired communication protocols but also the undesired patterns and organization structures in the agents communications allowing designers to define robust communication structures for this purpose this work presents 1 a language to define such patterns 2 a set of already defined desired and undesired patterns which usually appear in general mass 3 a tool that allows developers to automatically detect these patterns in logs of mas executions and 4 a guideline that takes developers through the testing of the communications in mass the current approach is experienced with a case study and the results show that the application of the current approach and the suppression of detected undesired patterns improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the corresponding mas 2013 elsevier ltd all rights

software engineering context many researchers adopting systematic reviews srs have also published papers discussing problems with the sr methodology and suggestions for improving it since guidelines for srs in software engineering se were last updated in 2007 we believe it is time to investigate whether the guidelines need to be amended in the light of recent research objective to identify evaluate and synthesize research published by software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing srs and their proposals for improving the sr process method we undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of undertaking srs and or discussing techniques that could be used to improve the sr process studies were classified with respect to the stage in the sr process they addressed whether they related to education or problems faced by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools results we identified 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in se conferences and journals between 2005 and mid 2012 the most common criticisms of srs were that they take a long time that se digital libraries are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the quality of empirical studies of different types is difficult conclusion we recommend removing advice to use structured questions to construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi gold standard based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings and evaluation of the search process textual analysis tools are likely to be useful for inclusion exclusion decisions and search string construction but require more stringent evaluation se researchers would benefit from tools to manage the sr process but existing tools

to maintain the quality of the code certain experienced developers review each patch before it can be applied or committed ideally within a short amount of time after its submission a patch is assigned to a reviewer and reviewed in the real world however many large and active oss projects evolve at a rapid pace and the core developers can get swamped with a large number of patches to review furthermore since these core members may not always be available or may choose to leave the project it can be challenging at times to find a good reviewer for a patch in this paper we propose a graph based method to automatically recommend the most suitable reviewers for a patch to evaluate our method we conducted experiments to predict the developers who will apply new changes to the source code

random walk when competition is pushed too hard an agent based model of strategic behaviour of referees in peer review this paper examines the impact of strategic behaviour of referees on the quality and efficiency of peer review we modelled peer review as a process based on knowledge asymmetry and subject to evaluation bias we built two simulation scenarios to investigate largescale implications of referee behaviour and judgment bias the first one was inspired by the luck of the reviewer draw idea in this case we assumed that referees randomly fell into type i and type ii errors i e recommending submissions of low quality to be published or recommending against the publishing of submissions which should have been published in the second scenario we assumed that certain referees tried intentionally to outperform potential competitors by underrating the value of their submissions we found that when publication selection increased the presence of a minority of cheaters may dramatically undermine the quality and efficiency of peer review even compared with a scenario purely dominated by the luck of the reviewer draw we also found that peer review outcomes are significantly influenced by differences in the way scientists identify potential competitors in the system ecms webjøm rekdalsbakken agent based model competition fairness peer review rational

software from the functional domains commonly referred to as business application or management information systems mis and real time software and hybrids of these in practice it is often sufficient to measure a functional size approximately typical situations where such a need arises are early in the life of a project before the functional user requirements fur have been specified down to the level of detail where the precise size measurement is possible or when a measurement is needed but there is insufficient time or no need to measure the required size using the standard method the guideline describes the current state of the art with regard to approximate cosmic functional size measurement all proposed cosmic approximation methods rely on determining some average of the size s and or number s of functional processes the fact that the size of a single functional process has no upper finite limit is probably the reason why multiple cosmic approximation methods have been developed for different types of software therefore the guideline describes a number of approximation methods with their pros and cons their recommended area of application and their validity rather than document a single cosmic approximation method 2013 ieee accuracy approximation classification cosmic scaling software measurement a semantic based semi automated role mapping mechanism copyright

the internet more and more web services can be found and used however service trustworthiness is one of the most critical factors to keep the confidence of users in using them in this paper we propose a novel approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of web services using the trust network and give a mechanism for service recommendation in consideration of the users different preference and perspectives we adopt the trust network to estimate the important degree of subjective evidence from different resources and filter the false or malicious evidence then we calculate the trustworthiness of web services according to both of subjective and objective evidence in addition to this we put forward a preference template to recommend the proper service to the users according to the users requirements finally we develop a system called sters to evaluate the service trustworthiness and recommend the service experiments conducted on a large scale real world dataset show that our method can effectively evaluate the trustworthiness of web services which helps users to select and use them qos trust network web service trustworthiness analyzing turkish e government websites by eye tracking usability studies provide essential information about users views and perceptions of efficiency effectiveness and satisfaction of given online services nowadays e government web sites become popular therefore there is a need for usability testing to specify the usability problems and to make the services of the e government more usable the purpose of this study is to investigate usability of some turkish e government services the study examined usability of five turkish e government web sites ministry of national education student information system eokul ministry of justice

artifacts during regulatory reviews safety critical systems emphasize the high quality of both hardware and software of a product since the safety of the product to the public tops all the other considerations in these domains regulatory agencies are entitled to conduct reviews on the entire range of artifacts produced from system design to system performance maintenance regulatory review is comprised of the pre market review and the post market review each aspect of the regulatory review is time consuming and laborious in this paper we target situations when errors are identified in the reviewed software either during pre or postmarket review we propose an automated mechanism which utilizes traceability information to identify lists of related software artifacts that are similar to those involved in the reported errors with the tool recommendations regulators can quickly investigate these suspicious locations and avoid the occurrence of future hazardous events 2013 ieee hazard

efficiency mobile assistance production software in the city visual guidance through large scale software projects the size of software projects at microsoft are constantly increasing this leads to the problem that developers and managers at microsoft have trouble to comprehend and overview their own projects in detail regarding that there are some research projects at microsoft with the goal to facilitate analyses on software projects those projects provide databases with metadata of the development process which developers managers and researchers can use as an example the data can be used for recommendation systems and bug analyses in the research field of visualization software there are a lot of approaches that try to visualize large software projects one approach which seems to reach that goal is the visualization of software with real life metaphors this paper combines existing research projects at microsoft with a visualization approach that uses the city metaphor the goal is to guide managers and developers in their day to day development decisions and to improve the comprehension of their software projects comparing collaborative filtering methods based on user topic ratings copyright 2013 by knowledge systems institute graduate school user based collaborative filtering cf has been successfully applied into recommender system for years the main idea of user based cf is to discover communities of users sharing similar interests however existing user based cf methods may be inaccurate due to the problem of data sparsity one possible way to improve it is to append new data sources into user based cf tags which are added and generated by users is one of the new sources in order to utilize tags effectively user topic based cf is proposed to extract features behind tags assign them to topics and measure users preferences on these topics in this paper we conduct comparisons between two user topic based cf methods based on different tag topic relations both methods calculate user topic preferences according to ratings of items and topic weights experiments are conducted on the data set of movielens the results show that usertopic based cf method is better than user based cf both in computational efficiency and recommendation effect the effects are significant especially when each tag belongs to multiple topics collaborative filtering recommender systems tag topic model pattern based methods for model based safety critical software architecture design a phd thesis proposal gesellschaft für informatik bonn 2013 software intensive systems that perform safety critical tasks are increasingly prevalent and pervasive in today s world driven by the incessant increase in the number of integrated control units communication systems and software managing architectural complexity let alone mastering it is becoming an increasingly difficult task safety standards recommend if not dictate performing many analyses during the concept phase of development as well as the early adoption of multiple measures at the architectural design level most of which has become part of the day today business of safety critical development yet has to receive adequate tool support this is particularly true if one wishes to front load these aspects into an integrated solution environment in which these mostly repetitive tasks can be automated model based development techniques are increasingly used and well suited for these parameters combining argumentation logic used for safety cases and safety concepts with abstract reasoning using model based system description i argue about architectural optimization for safety critical development my approach allows reasoning about the system through the use of compositional description which integrates physical environment models with system ifinctional description models and links problem solving patterns with component model libraries which include nominal as well as faulty behavior abey an incremental personalized method based on attribute entropy for recommender systems copyright 2013 by knowledge systems institute graduate school recording attribute frequencies and calculating user preferences on attributes are generally used in current personalized method user profile for recommender system in this paper we propose a new personalized method namely abey to do the personalization in another way abey firstly uses attribute entropies to calculates user preferences on attribute classes abey refines these preferences by wiping off some interferences and allocates a group of such preferences for each user at the end of measurement abey could re rank given recommendations according to aggregate attribute class preferences for them experiments are conducted on data sets collected from an e commerce site in real world the effectiveness of abey including accuracy coverage and novelty has been evaluated and the results indicate that abey can be a superior alternative to user profile on finding related items for individuals attribute entropy personalized method recommender systems user preference user profile blog recommender based on hypergraph modeling clustering algorithm in this paper we presents a new blog recommender based on the hyper graph modeling clustering algorithm the algorithm of this system is called multilevel clustering segmentation algorithm based on the hyper graph model under the hyper graph model each blog will be abstracted as a vertex of a hyper graph hyper edges will be built among the blogs which belong to the same result set gotten through the google blog searching by one keyword then the problem of recommender is translated into the clustering of a hyper graph our multilevel clustering algorithm is then used to do the segmentation and we set a new optimization index for the segmentation of a hyper graph which is called modularity through the definition of modularity it is not necessary for us to preset the partitioning number any more we do the segmentation with the aim to achieve the optimum value of modularity in addition hyper graph is born with the ability to solve problems with high dimension data and this ability of course will lead to more reasonable results compared with other models 2013 ieee hypergraph model modularity multilevel clustering segmentation algorithm recommender system can control component libraries reduce the costs of developing control engineering based self adaptive systems 2013 ieee many approaches have been proposed to develop self adaptive software systems based on control engineering methods in recent years however these research works only evaluate the self adaptive capabilities of the proposed control solution but no evaluation is performed to quantify the costs of implementing such a control solution this paper provides results of an empirical study conducted to quantify the implementation testing and knowledge requirement costs of building a self adaptive software system using control engineering methods our objective is to investigate whether these costs can be significantly reduced if a library of prepackaged control components is available to software engineers the findings of the study indicate that the aforementioned costs can be significantly reduced when supporting libraries are available we also list the lessons learned from this study and recommendations which may be useful in designing experiments to evaluate engineering costs of self adaptive methods in the future 0 1 programming model based method for planning code review using bug fix history 2013 ieee code review is a powerful activity for software quality improvement and is ideal to review all source files being developed however such an exhaustive review would be difficult because the available time and effort are in reality limited thus practitioners prioritize the source files in terms of bug proneness by using related data such as bug fix history and review them in decreasing order of priority such strategy in this paper is called the conventional method while the conventional method is straightforward it focuses only on the bug proneness and cannot consider the review cost properly so the method does not produce a cost effective review plan to take into account both the bug proneness and the review cost this paper proposes a 0 1 programming model based method for planning code review the proposed method formulates a review plan as a 0 1 programming problem and the solution is the recommendation list of source files to be reviewed moreover the proposed method considers the type of file if the file is newly developed or not such difference in file type may affect on how to evaluate the bug proneness and the review strategy newly developed files are notable but not appeared in the bug fix history this paper conducts a case study using popular open source software shows that the proposed method is up to 42 more effective than the conventional method in recommending buggy files as the review targets 0 1 programming model bug fix history code review cost effectiveness a new similarity function for selecting neighbors for each target item in collaborative filtering as one of the collaborative filtering cf techniques memory based cf technique which recommends items to users based on rating information of like minded users called neighbors has been widely used and has also proven to be useful in many practices in the age of information overload however there is still considerable room for improving the quality of recommendation shortly similarity functions in traditional cf compute a similarity between a target user and the other user without considering a target item more specifically they give an equal weight to each of the co rated items rated by both users neighbors of a target user therefore are identical for all target items however a reasonable assumption is that the similarity between a target item and each of the co rated items should be considered when finding neighbors of a target user additionally a different set of neighbors should be selected for each different target item thus the objective of this paper is to propose a new similarity function in order to select different neighbors for each different target item in the new similarity function the rating of a user on an item is weighted by the item similarity between the item and the target item experimental results from movielens dataset and netflix dataset provide evidence that our recommender model considerably outperforms the traditional cf based recommender model 2012 elsevier b v all rights reserved collaborative filtering information overload item similarity recommendation system advancing national greenhouse gas inventories for agriculture in developing countries improving activity data emission factors and software technology developing countries face many challenges when constructing national inventories of greenhouse gas ghg emissions such as lack of activity data insufficient measurements for deriving country specific emission factors and a limited basis for assessing ghg mitigation options emissions from agricultural production are often significant sources in developing countries particularly soil nitrous oxide and livestock enteric and manure methane in addition to wetland rice methane consequently estimating ghg emissions from agriculture is an important part of constructing developing country inventories while the challenges may seem insurmountable there are ways forward such as a efficiently using resources to compile activity data by combining censuses and surveys b using a tiered approach to measure emissions at appropriately selected sites coupled with modeling to derive country specific emission factors and c using advanced software systems to guide compilers through the inventory process with a concerted effort by compilers and assistance through capacity building efforts developing country compilers could produce transparent accurate complete consistent and comparable inventories as recommended by the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change in turn the resulting inventories would provide the foundation for robust ghg mitigation analyses and allow for the development of nationally appropriate mitigation actions and low emission development strategies 2013 iop publishing ltd activity data agricultural greenhouse gas emissions emission factors enteric methane manure methane national

methods which implement local illumination models simulating only direct interaction of light with 3d objects they do not take into account the energy exchange between the objects themselves making the resulting images look non optimal the main reason for this is the simulation of global illumination having a high computational complexity decreasing the frame rate extremely as a result this makes for example user interaction quite challenging one way to decrease the time of image generation using rendering methods which implement global illumination models is to involve additional compute nodes in the process of image creation distribute the rendering subtasks among these and then collate the results of the subtasks into a single image such a strategy is called distributed rendering in this paper we introduce a software interface which gives a recommendation how the distributed rendering approach may be integrated into vr frameworks to achieve lower generation time of high quality realistic images the interface describes a client server architecture which realizes the communication between visualization and compute nodes including data and rendering subtask distribution and may be used for the implementation of different load balancing methods we show an example of the implementation of the proposed interface in the context of realistic rendering of buildings for decisions on interior options 2013 ieee distributed rendering global illumination load balancing parallel rendering virtual environments holistically evaluating agent based social systems models a case study the philosophical perspectives on model evaluation can be broadly classified into reductionist logical positivist and relativist holistic in this paper we outline some of our past efforts in and challenges faced during evaluating models of social systems with cognitively detailed agents owing to richness in the model we argue that the holistic approach and consequent continuous improvement are essential to evaluating complex social system models such as these a social system built primarily of cognitively detailed agents can provide multiple levels of correspondence both at observable and abstract aggregated levels such a system can also pose several challenges including large feature spaces issues in information elicitation with database experts and news feeds counterfactuals fragmented theoretical base and limited funding for validation we subscribe to the view that no model can faithfully represent reality but detailed descriptive models are useful in learning about the system and bringing about a qualitative jump in understanding of the system it attempts to model – provided they are properly validated our own approach to model evaluation is to consider the entire life cycle and assess the validity under two broad dimensions of 1 internally focused validity quality achieved through structural methodological and ontological evaluations and 2 external validity consisting of micro validity macro validity and qualitative causal and narrative validity in this paper we also elaborate on selected validation techniques that we h ave employed in the past we recommend a triangulation of multiple validation techniques including methodological soundness qualitative validation techniques such as face validation by experts and

the evolution and migration of software libraries application programming interfaces apis are a common and industrially relevant means for third party software developers to reuse external functionality several techniques have been proposed to help migrate client code between library versions with incompatible apis but it is not clear how well these perform in an absolute sense we present a retroactive study into the presence and nature of api incompatibilities between several versions of a set of java based software libraries for each we perform a detailed manual analysis to determine what the correct adaptations are to migrate from the older to the newer version in addition we investigate whether any of a set of adaptation recommender techniques is capable of identifying the correct adaptations for library migration we find that a given api incompatibility can typically be addressed by only one or two recommender techniques but sometimes none serve furthermore those techniques give correct recommendations on average in only about 20 of cases 2012 acm adaptive change api recommendation systems who is going to mentor newcomers in open source projects when newcomers join a software project they need to be properly trained to understand the technical and organizational aspects of the project inadequate training could likely lead to project delay or failure in this paper we propose an approach named yoda young and newcomer developer assistant aimed at identifying and recommending mentors in software projects by mining data from mailing lists and versioning systems candidate mentors are identified among experienced developers who actively interact with newcomers then when a newcomer joins the project yoda recommends her a mentor that among the available ones has already discussed topics relevant for the newcomer yoda has been evaluated on software repositories of five open source projects we have also surveyed some developers of these projects to understand whether mentoring was actually performed in their projects and asked them to evaluate the mentoring relations yoda identified results indicate that top committers are not always the most appropriate mentors and show the potential usefulness of yoda as a recommendation system to aid project managers in supporting newcomers joining a software project 2012 acm developer mentoring empirical studies mining software repositories integrating wearable sensor technology into project management process a sensor based project management process which uses continuous sensing data of face to face communication was developed for integration into current project management processes to establish a practical process a sensing system was applied in two software development projects involving 123 and 65 employees respectively to analyze the relation between work performance and behavioral patterns and investigate the use of sensor data it was found that a factor defined as communication richness which refers to the amount of communication correlates with employee performance job evaluation and was common in both projects while other factors such as workload were found in just one of the projects developers quality of development low bug occurrence was also investigated in one of the projects and communication richness was found as a factor of high development quality as a result of this analysis we propose a four step sensor based project management process which consists of analysis monitoring inspection and action and evaluated its effectiveness through monitoring it was estimated that some unplanned events such as changing specifications and problem solving during a project could be systematically identified cohesion of a network was systematically

components are now vital to mainstream software development but as apis have become more important understanding how to make them more usable is becoming a significant research question to assess the current state of research in the field we conducted a systematic mapping a total of 28 papers were reviewed and categorized based on their research type and on the evaluation method employed by its authors we extended the analysis of a subset of the papers we reviewed beyond the usual limits of a systematic map in order to more closely examine details of their evaluations such as their structure and validity and to summarize their recommendations based on these results common problems in the field are discussed and future research directions are suggested 2012 ieee api usability application programming interface meta analysis systematic map systematic review a source code recommender system to support newcomers newcomers in a software development project often need assistance to complete their first tasks then a mentor an experienced member of the team usually teaches the newcomers what they need to complete their tasks but to allocate an experienced member of a team to teach a newcomer during a long time is neither always possible nor desirable because the mentor could be more helpful doing more important tasks during the development the team interacts with a version control system bug tracking and mailing lists and all these tools record data creating the project memory recommender systems can use the project memory to help newcomers in some tasks answering their questions thus in some cases the developers do not need a mentor in this paper we present mentor a recommender system to help newcomers to solve change requests mentor uses the prediction by partial matching ppm algorithm and some heuristics to analyze the change requests and the version control data and recommend potentially relevant source code that will help the developer in the change request solution we did three experiments to compare the ppm algorithm with the latent semantic indexing lsi using ppm we achieved results for recall rate between 37 and 66 8 and using lsi the results were

have difficulties in implementing exception handling code in their systems in particular they fail in implementing appropriate handling actions not surprisingly recurring failures and performance issues are often related to the poor exception handling actions implemented in real software systems in this paper we propose implement and evaluate a set of three heuristic strategies used to recommend exception handling code in programming tasks given a method in which the developer wants to handle an exception the heuristics recommend a list of code fragments implementing exception handling the heuristics goal is to accurately find code fragments implementing exception handling and recommend these fragments according to the context of developers implementation task hence the proposed heuristics may assist developers in the process of discovering exception handling actions relevant to their context by providing concrete examples we believe that a recommender system based on the proposed heuristics may be used in the future as a tool for aiding exception handling implementation 2012 ieee code example recommendation exception handling heuristic strategies analysis

different perspectives on what we need to do to improve the system conclusion involving both practitioners users and researchers in the evaluation elicited a range of useful feedback providing useful

recommendations to project stakeholders in many software intensive systems traceability is used to support a variety of software engineering activities such as impact analysis compliance verification and requirements validation however in practice traceability links are often created towards the end of the project specifically for approval or certification purposes this practice can result in inaccurate and incomplete traces and also means that traceability links are not available to support early development efforts we address these problems by presenting a trace recommender system which pushes recommendations to project stakeholders as they create or modify traceable artifacts we also introduce the novel concept of a trace obligation which is used to track satisfaction relations between a target artifact and a set of source artifacts we model traceability events and subsequent actions including user recommendations using the business process modeling notation bpmn we demonstrate and evaluate the efficacy of our approach through an illustrative example and a simulation conducted using the software engineering artifacts of a robotic system for supporting arm

entrainment of contention to innovation unintended acceleration in passenger vehicles congress is considering legislation to strengthen federal regulation of auto safety in response to hundreds of reported accidents and more than 50 fatalities that may be linked to sudden acceleration in certain makes of toyota and lexus vehicles toyota under pressure from the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has recalled more than 6 million autos in the united states and for a time stopped production of certain new model vehicles in an effort to address the problems one of the largest such efforts in recent history but lawmakers and consumer advocates say federal oversight has been inadequate given that nhtsa began investigating reports of sudden acceleration in certain toyotas in 2002 internal corporate documents indicate that toyota was slow to address other vehicle quality concerns nhtsa in april 2010 fined toyota 1 6 375 million the maximum allowed by law for failing to quickly notify the u s department of transportation dot of an accelerator pedal defect in some cars adding to the complexity of the situation is continuing uncertainty about the cause of the toyota incidents despite the recalls a series of nhtsa investigations and internal tests by toyota engineers since 2002 there is not a consensus as to whether reported incidents of sudden acceleration have been caused by sticking accelerator pedals poorly designed floor mats driver error glitches in the electronic throttle systems or some combination of factors dot officials have expanded their investigation into toyota operations are taking a broad look at the increasingly complex electronics in all u s automobiles and may recommend tougher standards for vehicles with electronic accelerators at the same time toyota has announced its own stepped up safety initiatives including installing brake override software a system that gives priority to braking when the brake and accelerator are depressed at the same time in some recalled and new model cars setting up an outside investigative panel headed by former transportation secretary rodney slater and changing its corporate structure lawmakers are considering a variety of issues as they craft a possible legislative response to the problems some members of congress are concerned that nhtsa did not conduct timely thorough investigations of consumer complaints about toyota vehicles and are examining whether the agency has sufficient staff and expertise particularly in electrical and software engineering to keep pace with the increasing complexity of autos nhtsa has two electrical engineers on staff secretary of transportation ray lahood has enlisted nasa engineers to assist nhtsa with its review another issue is whether the 2000 tread act enacted in response to deaths and accidents linked to firestone tires has been effective the act was designed to spur early warning of safety concerns compel auto manufacturers to expeditiously address problems and improve consumer information the number of automotive recalls has increased since the tread act was passed but most of the recalls are voluntary in part due to the lengthy legal process required in mandating a recall further the dot s 16 375 million fine against toyota is based on the dot s determination that the company did not comply with the tread act requirements to quickly report defects congress is also examining whether toyota problems are signs of broader issues in the automobile industry electronics and software in automobiles account for as much as 40 of the cost of producing a car and the systems are advancing to the point that they are used to control more essential safety features u s and foreign automakers carry out extensive testing of software and electronics based on industry guidelines and their own internal standards the quality control system is less rigorous than for other areas of the transportation

capabilities required to defend u s freedoms supporting said complex systems such as the mv 22 cv 22 aircraft requires being able to troubleshoot and mitigate complex failure modes in dynamic operational environments since an aircraft is comprised of multiple systems designed by specialty sub vendors and subsequently brought together by an aircraft integrator diagnostics at the aircraft level are usually good enough but not capable of 100 fault isolation to a single component today s system components must be highly integrated and are required to communicate via high speed data bus conduits which require precise synchronization between systems failure modes of aircraft are identified via design analysis and test prior to fielding of the weapon system however not all failure modes are typically known at the time of system initial operational capability but rather are found in the field by maintainers pilots and then subsequently mitigated with aircraft engineering changes or system replacements also the requirement for increased capabilities can drive the need for new systems to be integrated into an aircraft system that may not have been considered in the initial design and support concept there is a plethora of maintenance action detail collected by pilots maintenance officers mo and engineers that can and should be used to identify failure mode trends that come to light during the operational phase of an aircraft new troubleshooting techniques can be developed to address underlying failure modes to increase efficiency of future maintenance actions thus reducing the logistics trail required to support the aircraft the elements available for analysis are maintenance results input by the mo pilot including free form comments regarding problems and resulting actions built in test bit fault codes recorded during a flight and off aircraft test equipment such as consolidated automated support system cass historical test results the integrated support environment ise is collecting the data required to perform analysis of underlying maintenance trends that can be identified using some specialized software data mining tools such as text mining of corrective action and maintainer comments data fields from maintenance results the findings or knowledge extracted from text mining can be correlated back to fault codes recorded during flight and historical maintenance results to help mitigate issues with broken troubleshooting procedures causing headaches to the our sailors and marines in the field by tagging key phrases from the maintainer s pilot s remarks knowledge can be gleaned into how the aircraft fails in vigorous environments the premise of this research is to first choose an apparent high failure avionics system on the v 22 aircraft that is experiencing a high removal rate from the aircraft but subsequently found to be fully operational when tested on cass the results of this analysis should present potential root causes for cannot duplicate situations by recommending an augmentation of diagnostics at the aircraft level to avoid removing and replacing a system that has not failed even though it has reported bad via the aircraft diagnostics this research will utilize the net centric diagnostics framework ncdf to retrieve past smart test program set tps results bit sequence strings as a variable for identifying trends in v 22 aircraft maintenance actions the results of the research will be socialized with the v 22 avionics fleet support team and the comprehensive automated maintenance environment optimized cameo for validation of findings before any troubleshooting changes are recommended if required the integrated diagnostics and automated test systems group will perform an engineering analysis of problem and suggest an enhanced diagnostic technique to mitigate the issue 2011 ieee data mining diagnostics maintenance actions text mining v 22 beyond fixing bugs case studies of creative collaboration in open source software bug fixing processes copyright 2011 acm bug fixing is an important collaborative practice of open source software development creative

publishing limited information exchange information research libraries library buildings mobile communication systems undergraduates subjectivity handling of ratings for trust and reputation systems an abductive reasoning approach the majority of trust models consider two types of knowledge in estimating the trustworthiness of a trustee in an interaction experiences and recommendations however this leads to a nested trust problem how could we trust the recommendations even when the recommenders are not deceptive there is still a trust related problem due to the subjectivity of human judgment this paper describes a missing part of the existing trust management models handling the subjectivity of recommendations our approach is based on the idea that a recommender s judgment method can be inferred and the recommended entity can be re evaluated according to the value system of the truster who is about to make a decision extraction of the judgment method involves abductive reasoning which is implemented in the proposed account using subjective logic this approach has been quantitatively compared with two other methods our experiments show that our proposed solution outperforms an extended version of the beta trust model a trust model without subjectivity elimination our suggested method for trust and reputation systems may also be applied to other systems that include a rating mechanism such as recommender systems abductive reasoning rating recommender subjectivity trust ubicrowd 11 proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on ubiquitous crowdsouring

and crowdloc wireless jammer localization with crowdsourcing measurements failure is a four letter word a parody in empirical research background the past years have seen a surge of techniques predicting failure prone locations based on more or less complex metrics few of these metrics are actionable though aims this paper explores a simple easy to implement method to predict and avoid failures in software systems the irop method links elementary source code features to known software failures in a lightweight easy to implement fashion method we sampled the eclipse data set mapping defects to files in three eclipse releases we used logistic regression to associate programmer actions with defects tested the predictive power of the resulting classifier in terms of precision and recall and isolated the most defect prone actions we also collected initial feedback on possible remedies results in our sample set irop correctly predicted up to 74 of the failure prone modules which is on par with the most elaborate predictors available we isolated a set of four easy to remember recommendations telling programmers precisely what to do to avoid errors initial feedback from developers suggests that these recommendations are straightforward to follow in practice conclusions with the abundance of software development data even the simplest methods can produce actionable results copyright 2011 acm empirical research parody nothing else matters what predictive model should i use in past and recent years also thanks to the availability of data from software repositories several kinds of models have been built to characterize and in some cases to predict software change and fault proneness while a wide variety of change and fault proneness models have been built so far and although software repositories have opened the road towards promising research directions there are several issues still to be solved first we need to carefully assess and validate the quality of data sets used for our models second although predictive or explanatory models do not allow to claim for causation we need to better exploit software repositories with the aim of providing qualitative credible explanations to the statistical correlations captured by the models third and most important when building predictive models we often tend to forget what would be their ultimate usage i e providing advices and recommendations to developers with the aim of making their job easier and helping them to release more reliable software thus assessing models usability is crucial to favor their adoption copyright 2011 acm predictive models assessment predictive models in software engineering software repositories customization support for cbr based defect prediction background the prediction performance of a case based reasoning cbr model is influenced by the combination of the following parameters i similarity function ii number of nearest neighbor cases iii weighting technique used for attributes and iv solution algorithm each combination of the above parameters is considered as an instantiation of the general cbr based prediction method the selection of an instantiation for a new data set with specific characteristics such as size defect density and language is called customization of the general cbr method aims for the purpose of defect prediction we approach the question which combinations of parameters works best at which situation three more specific questions were studied rq1 does one size fit all is one instantiation always the best rq2 if not which individual and combined parameter settings occur most frequently in generating the best prediction results rq3 are there context specific rules to support the customization method in total 120 different cbr instantiations were created and applied to 11 data sets from the promise repository predictions were evaluated in terms of their mean magnitude of relative error mmre and percentage pred a of objects fulfilling a prediction quality level a for the third research question dependency network analysis was performed results most frequent parameter options for cbr instantiations were neural network based sensitivity analysis as the weighting technique un weighted average as the solution algorithm and maximum number of nearest neighbors as the number of nearest neighbors using dependency network analysis a set of recommendations for customization was provided conclusion an approach to support customization is provided it was confirmed that application of context specific rules across groups of similar data sets is risky and produces poor results copyright 2011 acm case based reasoning customization defect prediction dependency network analysis instantiation heuristic evaluation of distance learning management system interface as more and more technology finds its way into distance learning programs the more complicated system has become in the early stage of the

automatically generated links privacy aware spam detection in social bookmarking systems and the effects of navigation tools on the navigability of web based information systems biocreative iii interactive task an overview background the biocreative challenge evaluation is a community wide effort for evaluating text mining and information extraction systems applied to the biological domain the biocurator community as an active user of biomedical literature provides a diverse and engaged end user group for text mining tools earlier biocreative challenges involved many text mining teams in developing basic capabilities relevant to biological curation but they did not address the issues of system usage insertion into the workflow and adoption by curators thus in biocreative iii bc iii the interactive task iat was introduced to address the utility and usability of text mining tools for real life biocuration tasks to support the aims of the iat in bc iii involvement of both developers and end users was solicited and the development of a user interface to address the tasks interactively was requested results a user advisory group uag actively participated in the iat design and assessment the task focused on gene normalization identifying gene mentions in the article and linking these genes to standard database identifiers gene ranking based on the overall importance of each gene mentioned in the article and gene oriented document retrieval identifying full text papers relevant to a selected gene six systems participated and all processed and displayed the same set of articles the articles were selected based on content known to be problematic for curation such as ambiguity of gene names coverage of multiple genes and species or introduction of a new gene name members of the uag curated three articles for training and assessment purposes and each member was assigned a system to review a questionnaire related to the interface usability and task performance as measured by precision and recall was answered after systems were used to curate articles although the limited number of articles analyzed and users involved in the iat experiment precluded rigorous quantitative analysis of the results a qualitative analysis provided valuable insight into some of the problems encountered by users when using the systems the overall assessment indicates that the system usability features appealed to most users but the system performance was suboptimal mainly due to low accuracy in gene normalization some of the issues included failure of species identification and gene name ambiguity in the gene normalization task leading to an extensive list of gene identifiers to review which in some cases did not contain the relevant genes the document retrieval suffered from the same shortfalls the uag favored achieving high performance measured by precision and recall but strongly recommended the addition of features that facilitate the identification of correct gene and its identifier such as contextual information to assist in disambiguation discussion the iat was an informative exercise that advanced the dialog between curators and developers and increased the appreciation of challenges faced by each group a major conclusion was that the intended users should be actively involved in every phase of software development and this will be strongly encouraged in future tasks the iat task provides the first steps toward the definition of metrics and functional requirements that are necessary for designing a formal evaluation

accelerator pedal defect in some cars adding to the complexity of the situation is continuing uncertainty about the cause of the toyota incidents despite the recalls a series of nhtsa investigations and internal tests by toyota engineers since 2002 there is not a consensus as to whether reported incidents of sudden acceleration have been caused by sticking accelerator pedals poorly designed floor mats driver error glitches in the electronic throttle systems or some combination of factors dot officials have expanded their investigation into toyota operations are taking a broad look at the increasingly complex electronics in all u s automobiles and may recommend tougher standards for vehicles with electronic accelerators at the same time toyota has announced its own stepped up safety initiatives including installing brake override software a system that gives priority to braking when the brake and accelerator are depressed at the same time in some recalled and new model cars setting up an outside investigative panel headed by former transportation secretary rodney slater and changing its corporate structure lawmakers are considering a variety of issues as they craft a legislative response to the problems some members of congress are concerned that nhtsa did not conduct timely thorough investigations of consumer complaints about toyota vehicles and are examining whether the agency has sufficient staff and expertise particularly in electrical and software engineering to keep pace with the increasing complexity of autos nhtsa has two electrical engineers on staff secretary of transportation ray lahood has enlisted nasa engineers to assist nhtsa with its review another issue is whether the 2000 tread act enacted in response to deaths and accidents linked to firestone tires has been effective the act was designed to spur early warning of safety concerns compel auto manufacturers to expeditiously address problems and improve consumer information the number of automotive recalls has increased since the tread act was passed but most of the recalls are voluntary in part due to the lengthy legal process required in mandating a recall further the dot s 16 375 million fine against toyota is based on the dot s determination that the company did not comply with the tread act requirements to quickly report defects congress is also examining whether toyota problems are signs of bro ader issues in the automobile industry electronics and software in automobiles account for as much as 40 of the cost of producing a car and the systems are advancing to the point that they are used to control more essential safety features u s and foreign automakers carry out extensive testing of software and electronics based on industry guidelines and their own internal standards the quality control system is less rigorous than for other areas of the transportation sector however such as aviation cross library api recommendation using web search engines software systems are often built upon third party libraries developers may replace an old library with a new library for the consideration of functionality performance security and so on it is tedious to learn the often complex apis in the new library from the scratch instead developers may identify the suitable apis in the old library and then find counterparts of these apis in the new library however there is typically no such cross references for apis in different libraries previous work on automatic api recommendation often recommends related apis in the same library in this paper we propose to mine search results of web search engines to recommend related apis of different libraries in particular we use web search engines to collect relevant web search results of a given api in the old library and then recommend api candidates in the new library that are frequently appeared in the web search results preliminary results of generating related c apis for the apis in jdk show

mindful of some goals than others this paper presents an empirical study on usability goal achievement in industry projects we used usability goal setting tool ugt a recommender system that helps teams set prioritize and evaluate usability goals the practitioner creates profiles for the product and its users based on these inputs ugt helps the practitioner break down high level usability goals into more specific goal parameters and provides recommendations examples and guidelines to assign weights to these parameters ugt suggests strategies to evaluate goal parameters after the design is ready and assign them scores ugt was used to collect data from 65 projects in the indian software industry in which participants assigned weights and scores to the goal parameters the 30 goal parameters suggested by ugt were found to be internally reliable and having acceptable granularity and coverage it was observed that goal parameter weights and scores correlated but only moderately another interesting observation was that more than a third of the important goal parameters did not score well we identify eight goal parameters that are typically high weighted but have poor weight

suffers from some limitations such as scalability sparsity and recommendation attack prior work has shown incorporating trust mechanism into traditional collaborative filtering recommender systems can improve these limitations we argue that trust based recommender systems are facing novel recommendation attack which is different from the profile injection attacks in traditional recommender system to the best of our knowledge there has not any prior study on recommendation attack in a trust based recommender system we analyze the attack problem and find that victim nodes play a significant role

operational safety standard for software modelling iec 61508 part 3 safety standards are an important means for developing safety critical software systems usually they provide a set of requirements and recommendations in order to support implementing safe software such as the prominent iec 61508 functional safety standard meeting them leads to safer software and reduces the likelihood for harms on people and environment but for both the development team and assessors the application of the standard in practice is difficult and often leads to problems due to unclear requirements and missing acceptance criteria for this purpose a quality model for the safety standard helps applying the standard objectively and provides guidance for the software development team concrete measures and rules of code architecture and documentation analysis tools help to operationalize the standard that is covered by the quality model using documentation analysis tools helps supporting the project lead for determining the quality of the input and output artifacts of the lifecycle phases the application of the operational quality model for continuous quality assessments of software projects may contribute to emerging a safety culture in the organization as the developers become more safety aware in a first analysis we found out that over 50 percent of the analyzed tables in the annexes of iec 61508 part 3 can be measured largely by means of such automatic measurement tools using tools is important for the continuous quality assessment however we still need to analyze the rest of the standard s software part and apply it to projects in order to validate this approach in conclusion the focus of this paper is to show the need for an operational quality model for objectively applying the safety standard and for continuously giving guidance for stakeholders in the development process for safety critical software 2011 ieee iec 61508 measure operationalization quality model software safety standard towards the automatic generation of a semantic web ontology for musical instruments in this study we present a novel hybrid system by developing a formal method of automatic ontology generation for web based audio signal processing applications an ontology is seen as a knowledge management structure that represents domain knowledge in a machine interpretable format it describes concepts and relationships within a particular domain in our case the domain of musical instruments the different tasks of ontology engineering including manual annotation hierarchical structuring and organisation of data can be laborious and challenging for these reasons we investigate how the process of creating ontologies can be made less dependent on human supervision by exploring concept analysis techniques in a semantic web environment only a few methods have been proposed for automatic ontology generation these are mostly based on statistical methods e g frequency of semantic tags that generate the taxonomy structure of ontologies as in the studies from bodner and songs 1 the algorithms that have been used for automatic ontology generation are hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac bi section k means 2 and formal concept analysis fcm formal concept analysis is a well established technique for identifying groups of elements with common sets of properties formal concept analysis has been used in many software engineering topics such as the identication of ob jects in legacy code or the identication and restructuring of schema in ob ject oriented databases 5 these works are important since ontologies provide the basis for information and database systems 6 in this study we present a novel hybrid ontology generation system for musical instruments the music ontology is a semantic web ontology that describes music related information e g release artist performance but does not provide models of musical instruments hence there is a need to develop a separate instrument ontology to deepen how music knowledge is represented on the se mantic web such complementary knowledge on musical instruments can be useful to develop music recognition and recommendation systems based on semantic reasoning this work is a preliminary step which focuses on automatic instrument taxonomy generation in ontology web language owl the taxonomy of musical instruments given by hornbostel and sachs 3 was considered as the basis for our instrument terms and initial hierarchical structure the hybrid system consists of three main units i musical instrument analysis ii formal concept analysis iii lattice pruning and hierarchical form generation in the musical instrument analysis unit the system analyses the relationships between 12 predened classes of musical instruments chordophones aerophones bowed struck reed pipe instruments edge instruments brass instruments double reeds single reeds with valves without valves true utes and 10 musical instrument individuals bassoon cello clarinet flute oboe piano saxophone trombone tuba violin using a multi layer perceptron mlp classier the underlying audio features used in the recognition and classication system are the line spectral frequencies lsf which are derived from linear predictive analysis of the signal the lsf characterise well the timbral differences between instruments since they are related to the formant structure of the sounds spectral envelope which is an important aspect of the timbre in this study we used a database of isolated tones of various pitches and dynamics to train and test the system in the formal concept analysis unit the binary relations obtained from the mlp outputs are used to identify the common attributes individuals shared by different objects and generate a concept lattice form in the lattice pruning unit the concepts are ordered in the hierarchical concept order and a well structured hierarchical form using reduced label ling technique is created finally the reduced concept lattice labels and the class hierarchy of the instrument ontology is coded to the ontology web language by using the owl api java library 4 the results have given a conclusive evidence in favor of the hierarchical similarity to the taxonomy of musical instruments used as a reference 3 to the authors knowledge this is the rst study to investigate automatic ontology generation system in the context of audio and music analysis in further stages the outcomes of this work may be used in an application to establish an automated mechanism to identify and classify music sources and annotate them with rdf meta data we will also incorporate a wider set of musical instruments and use more owl language features e g ob ject data properties which is

bug report repository although its use can improve the software development process in a number of ways reports added to the repository need to be triaged a triager determines if a report is meaningful meaningful reports are then organized for integration into the project s development process to assist triagers with their work this article presents a machine learning approach to create recommenders that assist with a variety of decisions aimed at streamlining the development process the recommenders created with this approach are accurate for instance recommenders for which developer to assign a report that we have created using this approach have a precision between 70 and 98 over five open source projects as the configuration of a recommender for a particular project can require substantial effort and be time consuming we also present an approach to assist the configuration of such recommenders that significantly lowers the cost of putting a recommender in place

perspective on technical debt technical debt is a term that has been used to describe the increased cost of changing or maintaining a system due to expedient shortcuts taken during its development much of the research on technical debt has focused on decisions made by project architects and individual developers who choose to trade off short term gain for a longer term cost however in the context of enterprise software development such a model may be too narrow we explore the premise that technical debt within the enterprise should be viewed as a tool similar to financial leverage allowing the organization to incur debt to pursue options that it couldn t otherwise afford we test this premise by interviewing a set of experienced architects to understand how decisions to acquire technical debt are made within an enterprise and to what extent the acquisition of technical debt provides leverage we find that in many cases the decision to acquire technical debt is not made by technical architects but rather by non technical stakeholders who cause the project to acquire new technical debt or discover existing technical debt that wasn t previously visible we conclude with some preliminary observations and recommendations for organizations to better manage technical debt in the presence of some enterprise scale circumstances 2011 acm extended stakeholders leverage

generates a probabilistic feature model that represents commonalities variants and cross category features and then uses association rule mining and the k nearest neighbor machine learning strategy to generate product specific feature recommendations our recommender system supports the relatively labor intensive task of domain analysis potentially increasing opportunities for re use reducing time

bug triaging based on fuzzy set based modeling of bug fixing expertise of developers bugzie considers a system to have multiple technical aspects each is associated with technical terms then it uses a fuzzy set to represent the developers who are capable competent of fixing the bugs relevant to each term the membership function of a developer in a fuzzy set is calculated via the terms extracted from the bug reports that s he has fixed and the function is updated as new fixed reports are available for a new bug report its terms are extracted and corresponding fuzzy sets are union ed potential fixers will be recommended based on their membership scores in the union ed fuzzy set our preliminary results show that bugzie achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than other state of the art

change it this flat file exists within a context that can drastically influence how a developer approaches changing it while the developer clearly must be careful changing any code they probably should be yet more careful in changing code that recently saw major changes is barely covered by test cases and was the source of a number of bugs contextualized coding refers to the ability of the developer to effectively use such contextual information while they work on some changes in this paper we introduce the code orb a contextualized coding tool that builds upon existing mining and analysis techniques to warn developers on a line by line basis of the volatility of the code they are working on the key insight underneath the code orb is that it is neither desired nor possible to always present a code s context in its entirety instead it is necessary to provide an abstracted view of the context that informs the developer of which parts of the code they need to pay more

interacting control loops in self adaptive systems control loops in self adaptive systems are typically conceived as a sequence of four computations monitor analyze plan execute mape during the development of a traffic monitoring system with support for self healing we have noticed that simple mape loops are not sufficient to deal with the more complex failure scenarios to manage the adaptations in these scenarios we extend mape loops with support for two types of coordination first we introduce support for intra loop coordination enabling mape computations within one loop to coordinate with one another intra loop coordination allows the execution of multiple sub loops within one control loop second we introduce support for inter loop coordination enabling mape computations across multiple loops to coordinate with one another inter loop coordination allows the mape computations of different loops to coordinate the various phases of adaptations we show how we used the extensions to support self healing in the traffic monitoring system we discuss an implementation framework that supports coordination of mape loops and from our experiences offer recommendations for future research in this area 2011 acm control loop coordination mape self adaptation dynamic updating of online recommender systems via feed forward controllers recommender systems have become an essential software component of many online businesses supporting customers in finding the items e g books on amazon movies on netflix songs on last fm they are interested in key to their success is the level of accuracy they achieve the more precisely they can predict how much a customer will enjoy an item the higher the profit that the business will make e g in terms of more purchases in quantifying the accuracy of recommender systems the evaluation methodology followed by researchers has so far neglected an important aspect that these businesses grow continuously over time both in terms of users and items the data structures used by the recommender system to compute predictions become stale and thus have to be updated regularly intuitively the more often the data structures are being updated the higher the accuracy achieved but the higher the computational cost afforded because of the extremely large volume of data being handled system administrators often perform the update at fixed intervals of time e g weekly fortnightly in an effort to balance accuracy versus cost we argue that such an approach benefits neither accuracy nor cost as businesses do not grow linearly in time thus risking the fixed update interval to be at times too coarse with negative impact on accuracy and at other times too fine grained with negative impact on cost we thus advocate for a self monitoring and self adaptive approach whereby the system monitors its own growth over time estimates the loss in accuracy it would endure if an update were not being performed based on the observed growth and dynamically decides whether the benefit of performing an update accuracy outweighs its computational cost using real data from the bibsonomy website we demonstrate how this simple technique enables system administrators to transparently balance these two conflicting requirements 2011 acm recommender systems self adaptation self monitoring software development tools using gpgpu potentialities the paper deals with potentialities of various up to date software development tools for making use of graphic processor gpu parallel computing resources examples are given to illustrate the use of present day software tools for the development of applications and realization of algorithms for scientific technical calculations performed by gpgpu the paper presents some classes of hard mathematical problems of scientific technical calculations for which the gpgpu can be efficiently used is possible to reduce the time of calculation program development with the use of gpgpu capabilities various dedicated programming systems and problem oriented subroutine libraries are recommended performance parameters when solving the problems with and without the use of gpgpu potentialities are compared an approach towards automation firmware modeling for an exploration and evaluation of efficient parallelization alternatives due to stagnating cpu cycles future performance gains in automation firmware are unlikely to be achieved without parallelization for multi core architectures however for a sophisticated system comprising millions of lines of code this process induces significant effort especially when having to keep real time and safety conditions as efficiency matters in corporate software development obtaining maximum speedup by spending no more implementation effort than necessary is intended thus the design of a parallel firmware is recommended to base on the results of a model based exploration and evaluation of efficient parallelization alternatives for this purpose we developed the eeepa tool chain that starts with graph based firmware modeling on basis of dynamic event logs 2011 ieee automation firmware multi core architectures

multicenter clinical validation of the teledicom advanced interactive teleconsultation system there is a need to make medical diagnosis available to critically ill patients on site without the necessity of time consuming and risky transportation to larger reference hospitals the teleconsultation of medical images is possible with the use of internet based teledicom software developed in krakow poland interactive consultation between two or more centers offers real time voice communication visualization of synchronized digital imaging and communications in medicine images and use of interactive pointers and specific calculation tools if direct interaction between physicians is not needed the system can also be used in offline mode in 2006 teledicom was successfully deployed in the john paul ii hospital in krakow as well as a dozen other cooperating medical centers throughout southeast poland it is used for routine referral for cardiosurgical procedures aims of the study were to evaluate the image quality software stability constant availability data transmission speed and quality of realtime synchronized viewing of the images during the teledicom teleconsultation to evaluate the clinical utility of the teledicom system and to analyze the compatibility of teledicom with the storage data formats of various imaging machine manufacturers the analysis of angiographic offline teleconsultations was based on 918 patients referred remotely for coronary artery bypass grafting cabg the echocardiographic teleconsultations were performed during 63 live interactive consultations several of them were presented to live during medical conferences measurement tools of the teledicom software were tested against original measurement tools of echocardiographic machines from four different manufacturers as a result of teledicom consultation a cabg decision was made in 806 of 918 patients consulted 87 8 in remaining 12 patients medical therapy or percutaneous angioplasty was recommended cabg was performed in 98 6 of the admitted patients treatment decisions were changed after admission in 1 4 of patients however in all cases it was not related to analysis of angiography data but rather to the change of clinical condition of the patients all medical personnel involved in both offline and interactive teleconsultations judged the system positively in all assessed aspects lesser scores were observed only in the centers connected by slower networks measurements performed in the echo teledicom module were accurate as compared with those performed on a standard echo machine correlation r 0 980 p 0 001 independently of the echocardiograph model conclusion this study demonstrates that telemedicine can improve patients management using a clinically effective teleconsultation system the teledicom system is suited for professional use in the field of cardiovascular disease it is also prepared for remote live demonstrations of clinical cases during

telemedicine ultrasonography modeling quality attributes with aspect oriented architectural templates the quality attributes of a software system are to a large extent determined by the decisions taken early in the development process best practices in software engineering recommend the identification of important quality attributes during the requirements elicitation process and the specification of software architectures to satisfy these requirements over the years the software engineering community has studied the relationship between quality attributes and the use of particular architectural styles and patterns in this paper we study the relationship between quality attributes and aspect oriented software architectures which apply the principles of aspect oriented software development aosd at the architectural level aosd focuses on identifying modeling and composing crosscutting concerns i e concerns that are tangled and or scattered with other concerns of the application in this paper we propose to use ao adl an aspect oriented architectural description language to specify quality attributes by means of parameterizable and thus reusable architectural patterns we particularly focus on quality attributes that 1 have major implications on software functionality requiring the incorporation of explicit functionality at the architectural level 2 are complex enough as to be modeled by a set of related concerns and the compositions among them and 3 crosscut domain specific functionality and are related to more than one component in the architecture we illustrate our approach for usability a critical quality attribute that satisfies the previous constraints and that requires special attention at the requirements and the architecture design stages

physical therapy educators seek teaching methodologies to efficiently educate students the purpose of this article was to perform a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the use and effectiveness of computer assisted learning cal in physical therapy education criteria were established for article selection articles related to use included those reporting at least a 30 survey response return and a sample of at least 50 articles regarding effectiveness included only randomized control studies related to use in physical therapy and physical therapy assistant education six articles related to the use and 17 articles related to the effectiveness were identified early published investigations were focused in the area of anatomy the survey studies related to use indicated that educators highly valued cal but they reported initial use to be low due to cost expanding software development has resulted in higher contemporary use cal can effectively convey content material

process inherently has strong inter personal dynamics at play especially in how to find the optimal person to handle a bug report bug report reassignments which are a common part of the bug fixing process have rarely been studied in this paper we present a large scale quantitative and qualitative analysis of the bug reassignment process in the microsoft windows vista operating system project we quantify social interactions in terms of both useful and harmful reassignments for instance we found that reassignments are useful to determine the best person to fix a bug contrary to the popular opinion that reassignments are always harmful we categorized five primary reasons for reassignments finding the root cause determining ownership poor bug report quality hard to determine proper fix and workload balancing we then use these findings to make recommendations for the design of more socially aware bug tracking systems that can overcome some of the inefficiencies we observed in our study copyright 2011 acm bug reassignment bug tracking bug triaging can graduating students design revisited in this paper we revisit previous research to elaborate on the question can graduating students design software systems the work concluded that the answer was not really we wished to determine if this was true currently at our institution and also to look at whether students were able to design software in groups and evaluate others designs in summary it appears that our students just as in the original experiment struggle with doing design even in a group situation the representation of behavioural design was particularly lacking that said students were able to recognize weaknesses when evaluating other group designs based on our findings we provide several pedagogic recommendations design software engineering student performance architectural refactoring of a mission critical integration application a case study architecture refactoring can be thought of as a process of changing the architecture of an existing application without altering the functional behavior it is to improve the operational and developmental quality attributes such as performance stability complexity and maintainability due to changing business expectations as well as runtime environments architecture refactoring may need to be done incrementally over multiple software release cycles in this industry experience report we present an architectural refactoring of a mission critical integration application after it was originally implemented we discuss the drivers behind the refactoring and the approach initial results from the refactoring show significant improvement of stability and throughput of the system we also present recommendations on architectural refactoring and discuss the importance of key performance indicators that drive architecture refactoring architecture refactoring software maintenance flow augmented call graph a new foundation for taming api complexity software systems often undergo significant changes in their life cycle exposing increasingly complex api to their developers without methodical guidances it is easy to become bogged down in a morass of complex api even for the professional software developers this paper presents the flow augmented call graph facg for taming api complexity augmenting the call graph with control flow analysis brings us a new insight to capture the significance of the caller callee linkages in the call graph we apply the proposed facg in api recommendation and compare our approach with the state of the art approaches in the same domain the evaluation result indicates that our approach is more effective in retrieving the relevant apis with regard to the original api documentation 2011 springer verlag api recommendation control flow analysis static analysis an empirical study of long lived code clones previous research has shown that refactoring code clones as soon as they are formed or discovered is not always feasible or worthwhile to perform since some clones never change during evolution and some disappear in a short amount of time while some undergo repetitive similar edits over their long lifetime toward a long term goal of developing a recommendation system that selectively identifies clones to refactor as a first step we conducted an empirical investigation into the characteristics of long lived clones our study of 13558 clone genealogies from 7 large open source projects over the history of 33 25 years in total found surprising results the size of a clone the number of clones in the same group and the method level distribution of clones are not strongly correlated with the survival time of clones however the number of developers who modified clones and the time since the last addition or removal of a clone to its group are highly correlated with the survival time of clones this result indicates that the evolutionary characteristics of clones may be a better indicator for refactoring needs than static or spatial characteristics such as loc the number of clones in the same group or the dispersion of clones in a system 2011 springer verlag code clones empirical study refactoring software evolution measuring and predicting software productivity a systematic map and review context software productivity measurement is essential in order to control and improve the performance of software development for example by identifying role models e g projects individuals tasks when comparing productivity data the prediction is of relevance to determine whether corrective actions are needed and to discover which alternative improvement action would yield the best results objective in this study we identify studies for software productivity prediction and measurement based on the identified studies we first create a classification scheme and map the studies into the scheme systematic map thereafter a detailed analysis and synthesis of the studies is conducted method as a research method for systematically identifying and aggregating the evidence of productivity measurement and prediction approaches systematic mapping and systematic review have been used results in total 38 studies have been identified resulting in a classification scheme for empirical research on software productivity the mapping allowed to identify the rigor of the evidence with respect to the different productivity approaches in the detailed analysis the results were tabulated and synthesized to provide recommendations to practitioners conclusion risks with simple ratio based measurement approaches were shown in response to the problems data envelopment analysis seems to be a strong approach to capture multivariate productivity measures and allows to identify reference projects to which inefficient projects should be compared regarding simulation no general prediction model can be identified simulation and statistical process control are promising methods for software productivity prediction overall further evidence is needed to make stronger claims and recommendations in particular the discussion of validity threats should become standard and models need to be compared with each other 2010 elsevier b v all rights reserved efficiency measurement performance prediction software

five process technology generations executing 61 diverse benchmarks with a rigorous methodology we measure representative intel ia32 processors with technologies ranging from 130nm to 32nm while they execute sequential and parallel benchmarks written in native and managed languages during this period hardware and software changed substantially 1 hardware vendors delivered chip multiprocessors instead of uniprocessors and independently 2 software developers increasingly chose managed languages instead of native languages this quantitative data reveals the extent of some known and previously unobserved hardware and software trends two themes emerge i workload the power performance and energy trends of native workloads do not approximate managed workloads for example a the spec cpu2006 native benchmarks on the i7 45 and i5 32 draw significantly less power than managed or scalable native benchmarks and b managed runtimes exploit parallelism even when running single threaded applications the results recommend architects always include native and managed workloads when designing and evaluating energy efficient hardware ii architecture clock scaling microarchitecture simultaneous multithreading and chip multiprocessors each elicit a huge variety of power performance and energy responses this variety and the difficulty of obtaining power measurements recommends

combine reducing the long software production lifecycles as required by time to market demands with increasing the quality of the software developed for the automotive domain software process improvement spi provides the first step in the move towards software quality and assessments are a vital part of this process unfortunately software process assessments are often expensive and time consuming additionally they often provide companies with a long list of issues without providing realistic improvement suggestions the increasing need for software in the automotive industry provides small tomedium sized smes organizations with a good opportunity to work as software suppliers for the large car manufacturing companies in order to achieve this they have to provide high quality

engineering since it promises large gains in productivity quality and time to market reduction one of the main reasons software reuse has not been systematically practiced is due to the lack of education in a survey collected from 113 respondents from 29 organizations primarily in the us only 13 said they had learned about reuse in school 1 this paper presents the creation of a graduate level seminar course on software reuse in a us institution whose software engineering program aims to educate students with strong technical skills so they can start work as productive members on a

of software reuse education describes the reuse of frakes course modules and assessments and discusses the modifications we made in our course in particular we modified our course by incorporating two pedagogical principles active learning and cooperative learning redesigning the course from a lecture format to a seminar format allowed the students to play active roles in leading the classes and in discovering term paper topics that suited to their own research interests fostering collaborations among students and interactions between students and instructor allowed the students to recognize

environmental management systems emss a key requirement of iso certified emss is continual improvement which can be better managed with life cycle thinking this paper presents a review of the current application of lca in the mining industry it discusses the current application the issues and challenges and makes relevant recommendations for new research to improve the current situation main features the paper reviews the major published articles in the literature pertaining to lca methodology as applied in the mining industry the challenges associated with lca applications in mining are discussed next finally the authors present recommended research areas to increase the application of lca in the mining industry results the literature review shows a limited number of published mining lca studies the paper also shows the variation in functional unit definition for mining lca studies the challenges and research needed to address the problems are highlighted in the discussions discussion the limited number of mining lcas may be due to the lack of life cycle thinking in the industry the paper however highlights the major contributions in the literature to lca practice in the mining industry this paper discusses the lack of lca awareness and tools for mining lcas issues relating to functional unit and scoping of mining product systems defining adequate and appropriate impact categories and challenges with uncertainty and sensitivity analysis the authors recommend that future research focus on the development of a mining specific lca framework data uncertainty characterization and software development to increase the application of lca in mining conclusions lca presents beneficial insights to the mining industry as it seeks to develop world class emss and environmentally sustainable projects however to take full advantage of this technique further research is necessary to improve the level of lca application in mining major challenges have been identified and recommended research areas have been proposed to improve the situation the paper outlines the benefits of increased application of lca in the mining industry to lca databases and all practitioners recommendations and perspectives it is recommended that additional research be undertaken through industry academia partnerships to develop a more rigorous mining specific lca framework such a framework should allow for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis while allowing for suitable data collection that still covers the temporal and spatial dimensions of mining research should also be carried out to develop objective ways of characterizing the uncertainty introduced in a lca study due to the use of secondary data emissions factors from prior studies finally new software or guis that address the peculiarities of mining should be developed to help mining professionals with basic lca knowledge to undertake lca studies of their systems and mines 2010 springer verlag lca

background objectives the epic soft program the software initially developed to conduct 24 h dietary recalls 24 hdrs in the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic study was recommended as the best way to standardize 24 hdrs for future pan european dietary monitoring within european food consumption validation efcoval epic soft was adapted and further developed on various aspects that were required to optimize its use in this paper we present the structure and main interview steps of the epic soft program after implementation of a series of new specifications deemed to satisfy specific requirements of pan european monitoring surveys and other international studies subjects methods updates to optimize the epic soft program were ascertained according to the following stepwise approach 1 identification of requested specifications to be potentially implemented through an ad hoc ‘epic soft specifications questionnaire sent to past current and possible future users of the software 2 evaluation of the specifications in collaboration with two ad hoc task force groups and through a workshop 3 development of a technical solution for each retained specification 4 implementation of the specifications by software developers 5 testing and amendment of bugs results a number of new specifications and facilities were implemented to epic soft program in addition the software underwent a full reprogramming and migration to a modern windows environment including changes in its internal architecture and user interface although the overall concept and structure of the initial software were not changed substantially these improvements ease the current and future use of epic soft and increase further its adaptation to other countries and study contexts conclusions epic soft is enriched with further functions and facilities expected to fulfil specific needs of pan european dietary monitoring and risk assessment purposes the validity feasibility and

systems engineering web services a graph based approach to api usage adaptation reusing existing library components is essential for reducing the cost of software development and maintenance when library components evolve to accommodate new feature requests to fix bugs or to meet new standards the clients of software libraries often need to make corresponding changes to correctly use the updated libraries existing api usage adaptation techniques support simple adaptation such as replacing the target of calls to a deprecated api however cannot handle complex adaptations such as creating a new object to be passed to a different api method or adding an exception handling logic that surrounds the updated api method calls this paper presents libsync that guides developers in adapting api usage code by learning complex api usage adaptation patterns from other clients that already migrated to a new library version and also from the api usages within the library s test code libsync uses several graph based techniques 1 to identify changes to api declarations by comparing two library versions 2 to extract associated api usage skeletons before and after library migration and 3 to compare the extracted api usage skeletons to recover api usage adaptation patterns using the learned adaptation patterns libsync recommends the locations and edit operations for adapting api usages the evaluation of libsync on real world software systems shows that it is highly correct and useful with a precision of 100 and a recall of 91 2010 acm api evolution api usage adaptation api

problems balancing competing goals e g quality versus cost time to market versus resources or cohesion versus coupling finding a suitable balance between contrasting goals is often complex and recommendation systems are useful to support developers and managers in performing such a complex task we believe that contrasting goals can be often dealt with game theory techniques indeed game theory is successfully used in other fields especially in economics to mathematically propose solutions to strategic situation in which an individual s success in making choices depends on the choices of others to demonstrate the applicability of game theory to software engineering and to understand its pros and cons we propose an approach based on game theory that recommend extract class

bias on software developer tester performance background during all levels of software testing the goal should be to fail the code however software developers and testers are more likely to choose positive tests rather than negative ones due to the phenomenon called confirmation bias confirmation bias is defined as the tendency of people to verify their hypotheses rather than refuting them in the literature there are theories about the possible effects of confirmation bias on software development and testing due to the tendency towards positive tests most of the software defects remain undetected which in turn leads to an increase in software defect density aims in this study we analyze factors affecting confirmation bias in order to discover methods to circumvent confirmation bias the factors we investigate are experience in software development testing and reasoning skills that can be gained through education in addition we analyze the effect of confirmation bias on software developer and tester performance method in order to measure and quantify confirmation bias levels of software developers testers we prepared pen and paper and interactive tests based on two tasks from cognitive psychology literature these tests were conducted on the 36 employees of a large scale telecommunication company in europe as well as 28 graduate computer engineering students of bogazici university resulting in a total of 64 subjects we evaluated the outcomes of these tests using the metrics we proposed in addition to some basic methods which we inherited from the cognitive psychology literature results results showed that regardless of experience in software development testing abilities such as logical reasoning and strategic hypotheses testing are differentiating factors in low confirmation bias levels moreover the results of the analysis to investigate the relationship between code defect density and confirmation bias levels of software developers and testers showed that there is a direct correlation between confirmation bias and defect proneness of the code conclusions our findings show that having strong logical reasoning and hypothesis testing skills are differentiating factors in the software developer tester performance in terms of defect rates we recommend that companies should focus on improving logical reasoning and hypothesis testing skills of their employees by designing training programs as future work we plan to replicate this study in other software development companies moreover we will use confirmation bias metrics in addition to product and process metrics in for software defect prediction we believe that confirmation bias metrics would improve the prediction performance of learning based defect prediction models which we have been building over a decade cognitive biases confirmation bias software engineering software testing replication of defect prediction studies problems pitfalls and recommendations background the main goal of the promise repository is to enable reproducible and thus verifiable or refutable research over time plenty of data sets became available especially for defect prediction problems aims in this study we investigate possible problems and pitfalls that occur during replication this information can be used for future replication studies and serve as a guide line for researchers reporting novel results method we replicate two recent defect prediction studies comparing different data sets and learning algorithms and report missing information and problems results even with access to the original data sets replicating previous studies may not lead to the exact same results the choice of evaluation procedures performance measures and presentation has a large inuence on the reproducibility additionally we show that trivial and random models can be used to identify overly optimistic evaluation measures conclusions the best way to conduct easily reproducible studies is to share all associated artifacts e g scripts and programs used when this is not an option our results can be used to simplify the replication task for other researcher defect prediction model replication case based reasoning vs parametric models for software quality optimization background there are many data mining methods but few comparisons between them for example there are at least two ways to build quality optimizers programs that find project options that change quality measures like defects development effort total staff hours and time elapsed calendar months in the first way we construct a parametric model to represent prior software projects in the second way we just apply case based reasoning to reason directly from historical cases aim to assess case based reasoning vs parametric modeling for quality optimization method we compared the w case based reasoner against the seewaw parametric modeling tool results w is easy to explain and fast to build it makes no parametric assumptions and hence can be rapidly applied to project data in many formats seesaw is an elaborate tool that can only process project data expressed in a particular ontology i e just the cocomo attributes it is also slower to execute than w in 24 different tests comparing w and seesaw w always performs at least as well as seesaw in 6 of those tests w performed statistically better all tests used mann whitney 95 confidence lastly like any cbr method it comes with a built in maintenance strategy just add more cases conclusion the w case based reasoning tool is recommended over the seesaw parametric modeling tool for purposes of quality optimization except in the case where there is no local data analogy case based reasoning cocomo effort estimation optimization parametric

availability modelling of a virtual black box for automotive systems recent developments in automotive systems recommend storing historical information in a black box in a manner that is similar to the avionics domain the idea is to record relevant information about the vehicle that can be retrieved in case of a problem however instead of using a classical hardware based black box that could induce a high cost a more cost effective solution would be to use a software based mechanism that consists in storing the recorded data on a dedicated server at the fixed infrastructure to protect the data against potential losses before an access to the fixed infrastructure is available the data can be replicated and temporarily stored on neighbouring encountered vehicles using wireless communication technologies before being permanently saved on the server the aim of this paper is to analyse and evaluate the availability of the historical data recorded in the virtual black box vbb

computing multimedia systems software evaluation the effects of human computer interaction modes for weak learners in an animation learning environment the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction mode most effective for weak learners who lack fundamental knowledge and often had difficulty in comprehension of the learning subject in learning with animation participants were twenty seven undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory data structures course they were randomly assigned into one of the three treatments pure reasoning predicting orientation or reasoning predicting combination interaction they interacted with two animations they then received a learning experience survey and a learning transfer test immediately after interacting with each animation which demonstrated an example of avl tree insertion algorithm and data structure our findings indicate that the reasoning predicting combination interaction led to the greatest transfer performance and was rated by students as the most useful interaction for understanding the animation content the findings recommend that for weak learners interaction for reasoning was effective to develop near transfer ability at the initial learning phase whereas when learners knowledge grew to be capable of near transfer task the predicting orientation interaction became helpful to gain far transfer

for requiring significant amounts of storage for each user or item to be added to the database this is a problem whenever the collaborative filtering task is larger than the medium sized netix prize data in this paper we propose a new model for representing and compressing matrix factors via hashing this allows for essentially unbounded storage at a graceful storage performance trade off for

embedded networked sensors more specifically it is designed to support the concurrency in intensive operations required by networked sensors with minimal hardware requirements existing process scheduling algorithms of pi cos a commercial tiny low footprint real time operating system have their associated drawbacks an efficient alternative algorithm based on a randomized selection policy has been proposed demonstrated confirmed for efficiency and fairness on the average and has been recommended for implementation in picos simulations were carried out and performance measures such as average waiting time awt and average turn around time att were used to assess the efficiency of the proposed randomized version over the existing ones the results prove that randomized algorithm is the best and most attractive for implementation in picos since it is most fair and has the least awt and att on average over the other non preemptive scheduling algorithms implemented in this paper

usability guidelines that clearly define what characteristics a software system should have in order to be easy to use however in the software engineering se community keep falling short of successfully incorporating these recommendations into software projects from a se perspective the process of incorporating usability features into software is not always straightforward as a large number of these features have heavy implications in the underlying software architecture for example successfully including an undo feature in an application requires the design and implementation of many complex interrelated data structures and functionalities our work is focused upon providing developers with a set of software design patterns to assist them in the process of designing more usable software this would contribute to the proper inclusion of specific usability features with high impact on the software design preliminary validation data show that usage of the guidelines also

recommendations are known for decades mcilroy 1968 one approach that tries to tackle this problem at the very beginning of the development circle is model driven architecture mda miller et al 2001 the core idea behind mda is the creation of a comprehensive system model that is based on several abstraction levels omg 2002 these different modeling layers as well as a set of transformations between them allow for the automatic generation of most of the code needed whereas typically uml 2 which is also based on the same multi layer modeling approach is used to create the required abstract

proposed a personalized web service recommender system that will be very useful to the user in finding web service matching his her needs a recommender system helps product service user to deal with information overload and provides personalized recommendation to them there have been a few web service recommendation system in past but most of them are either content based or collaborative

artificial market simulations and qualitative research in diffusion of innovation artificial markets ams are an emerging form of agent based simulation abs in which agents represent individual consumers firms or industries interacting under simulated market conditions the validity of the method depends on the ability of researchers to construct simulated agents that faithfully capture the key behavior of targeted entities without such a correspondence the simulation cannot be considered to be a valid representation of market dynamics to date no such correspondence has been established yet for artificial markets to achieve their potential as a tool for marketing practice it is crucial that closer ties be forged with mainstream methods for consumer behavioral research especially qualitative methods the primary contribution of this article is a novel method combining qualitative marketing research inductive case studies grounded theory and sequence analysis and software engineering techniques to synthesize simulation ready theories of consumer behavior we provide a step by step explanation and a demonstrative example of theory building from the consumer technology adoption domain the outcome is a theory of consumer adoption behavior that is sufficiently precise and formal to be expressed in unified modeling language uml the article concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the method recommendations for its implementation in the study of diffusion of innovation doi and suggestions for further research the arguments and findings in this article that pertain to artificial markets can be generalized with respect to most agent based simulations including those applied to the study of diffusion of innovation the results of an abs of innovation diffusion cannot be relied upon unless the agents are based on a theory of adoption that grounded in empirical observations of the targeted entities regardless of whether those entities are consumers

most important problems in software development to better address this problem it is very recommended to have an abstraction level high enough to model complex systems architectural description

defect prediction models in large organizations has many challenges due to limited resources and tight schedules in the software development lifecycle it is not easy to collect data utilize any type of algorithm and build a permanent model at once we have conducted a study in a large telecommunications company in turkey to employ a software measurement program and to predict pre release defects based on our prior publication we have shared our experience in terms of the project steps i e challenges and opportunities we have further introduced new techniques that improve our earlier results objective in our previous work we have built similar predictors using data representative for us software development our task here was to check if those predictors were specific solely to us organizations or to a broader class of software method we have presented our approach and results in the form of an experience report specifically we have made use of different techniques for improving the information content of the software data and the performance of a naïve bayes classifier in the prediction model that is locally tuned for the company we have increased the information content of the software data by using module dependency data and improved the performance by adjusting the hyper parameter decision threshold of the naïve bayes classifier we have reported and discussed our results in terms of defect detection rates and false alarms we also carried out a cost benefit analysis to show that our approach can be efficiently put into practice results our general result is that general defect predictors which exist across a wide range of software in both us and turkish organizations are present our specific results indicate that concerning the organization subject to this study the use of version history information along with code metrics decreased false alarms by 22 the use of dependencies between modules further reduced false alarms by 8 and the decision threshold optimization for the naïve bayes classifier using code metrics and version history information further improved false alarms by 30 in comparison to a prediction using only code metrics and a default decision threshold conclusion implementing statistical techniques and machine learning on a real life scenario is a difficult yet possible task using simple statistical and algorithmic techniques produces an average detection rate of 88 although using dependency data improves our results it is difficult to collect and analyze such data in general therefore we would recommend optimizing the hyper parameter of the proposed technique naïve bayes to calibrate the defect prediction model rather than employing more complex classifiers we also recommend that researchers who explore statistical and algorithmic methods for defect prediction should spend less time on their algorithms and more time on studying the pragmatic considerations of large organizations 2010 elsevier b v all rights reserved experience report naïve bayes software defect prediction static code attributes constraint based recommendation for software project effort

recommending estimation methods that best match the software development project s characteristics and context has been developed the knowledgebased recommender exploits an explicit knowledge base in order to infer matching items based on the software project s context the contribution of this article lies in presenting a constraint based reasoning mechanism for computing recommendable items from a large set of choices and in its application to the domain of software project management it discusses a recommendation model for effort estimation methods and presents specific extensions like explanation and repair mechanisms that proved exceptionally useful in this application domain the application was conceptualized and developed in an iterative process and results from two rounds of

successfully manage large distributed software projects a case study from the cruise line industry agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi polar choices agile methods such as scrum and xp are recommended for small co located projects that involve changing requirements the traditional structured plan driven approaches such as the capability maturity model cmm and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks are recommended for large projects with stable requirements if a project is large strategically important distributed and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes we conclude that this balance is not only workable but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals agile without structure can cause chaos particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning control and coordination are critical structure without agility can lead to rigidity particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning discovery and changes 2010 by the authors administrative functional system case study development approach organization outsourcing project stakeholder involvement transaction system a decision support system utilizing a semantic agent the adaptabilty rapidity and focus on high quality solutions offered by agile methodology have lead to a paradigm shift in the software development process in many enterprises agile methodology is iterative in nature with each iteration i e timebox lasting 2 6 weeks iterations involve small teams comprising 9 19 developers working through the entire software development life cycle agile methodology works on two basic principles the first being regular adaptation to changing circumstances and the second focus on technical excellence and good design and high quality code the first principle accommodates that tasks in an agile project cannot be predicted more than a week in advance thus the need arises for project teams to incorporate experts in the problem domain such that they are better equipped to handle changes rapidly however this methodology has been criticised as it may not bring about the benefits intended by the second principle unless practised by skilled programmers who can create high quality code hence a project manager should be equipped with a highly skilled team we propose the utilization of a semantic agent 4 which will act on behalf of the project manager and suggest experts based on a set of parameters our semantic agent is based on a semantic matching algorithm 7 this algorithm utilizes an ontology based similarity framework to make recommendations and suggest training paths to satisfy the requirements of the project manager the agent uses this algorithm to recommend employees based on their expertise past experience and availability further based on recommendations made by the agent we classify employees as experts and non experts and suggest knowledge transfer 8 methods to upgrade their skills 2010 ieee agile methodology knowledge transfer ontology semantic agent semantic matching algorithm personalization recommendation service in enterprise information portal collaborative filtering algorithm is one of the most successful technologies for building recommender systems and is extensively

development bug reports provide crucial information to developers however these reports widely differ in their quality we conducted a survey among developers and users of apache eclipse and mozilla to find out what makes a good bug report the analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply most developers consider steps to reproduce stack traces and test cases as helpful which are at the same time most difficult to provide for users such insight is helpful for designing new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information our cuezilla prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality we trained cuezilla on a sample of 289 bug reports rated by developers as part of the survey the participants of our survey also provided 175 comments on hurdles in reporting and resolving bugs based on these comments we discuss several recommendations for better bug tracking systems which should focus on engaging bug reporters better tool support and improved handling of bug duplicates 2010 ieee and

software development and maintenance when library components evolve to accommodate new feature requests to fix bugs or to meet new standards the clients of software libraries often need to make corresponding changes to correctly use the updated libraries existing api usage adaptation techniques support simple adaptation such as replacing the target of calls to a deprecated api however cannot handle complex adaptations such as creating a new object to be passed to a different api method or adding an exception handling logic that surrounds the updated api method calls this paper presents libsync that guides developers in adapting api usage code by learning complex api usage adaptation patterns from other clients that already migrated to a new library version and also from the api usages within the library s test code libsync uses several graph based techniques 1 to identify changes to api declarations by comparing two library versions 2 to extract associated api usage skeletons before and after library migration and 3 to compare the extracted api usage skeletons to recover api usage adaptation patterns using the learned adaptation patterns libsync recommends the locations and edit operations for adapting api usages the evaluation of libsync on real world software systems shows that it is highly correct and useful with a precision of 100 and a recall of 91

features of items can be deployed to improve the quality of recommendations in recommender systems by incorporating them into similarity calculation between any two users or two items however the

evolving to new circumstances modifications to software do not always involve changes to a single well encapsulated module software developers are often faced with modification task that involve changes to source code artifacts such as function and comments that are spread across the code base developer must ensure that related entities are updated accordingly to be consistent with changes in this paper we propose hybrid approach that combines the best of data mining and impact analysis techniques to improve the overall performance precision and recall of change propagation heuristics our aim is to investigate the function co change in large software systems over period of time by utilizing various heuristics such as function dependencies and history it is not always every heuristic is good predictor for each entity therefore we augment our effort to provide recommendations to programmers based on the prediction of heuristics that are best for entity needed to be changed in this

developers few have been evaluated using human based evaluation strategies in studying situations where recommendation systems have been used or might be used we have observed that issues related to trust are important to a developer s acceptance of recommendations in this position paper we outline the trust issues that we have identified and suggest some mechanisms for promoting trust in recommendation systems aimed at software developers recommendation software development trust on recommending meaningful names in source and uml meaningful method names are crucial for the readability and maintainability of software existing naming conventions focus on syntactic details leaving programmers with little or no support in choosing meaningful domain names in this paper we propose to build a recommendation system that supports software developers and software architects when naming identifiers in source code as well as when naming elements in uml diagrams we discuss related work outline the design of such a recommendation system and discuss possible evaluation strategies copyright 2010 acm a recommendation framework for allocating global software teams in software product line projects in order to improve software quality and reduce costs and deadlines many companies are adopting software product line approaches as a consequence of globalization another common practice is the adoption of global software development approaches which seek to find more qualified workforce and more attractive costs in companies distributed around the world taking into account the benefits of both approaches the ramework proposed in this paper has the goal of aiding the management of global software teams involved in the implementation phase of an spl project providing recommendations on how to allocate the teams to the set of software components which are initially specified in the spl architecture and must be subsequently implemented copyright 2010 acm global software development global software teams recommendation systems software product line recommending experts using communication history in distributed software development the communication is inefficient because of geographical and temporal distances affecting the team s performance and awareness the low level of awareness makes hard the task of finding the expert of a piece of source code delaying the implementation whenever a developer needs help to identify and to recommend the people with right knowledge to people in trouble during the implementation can improve the collaboration and awareness of the team because it can reduce the waiting time for an answer since the expert can be contacted directly in this paper we propose recommender system for expert location with the aim to reduce delays of finding the right person whenever somebody needs assistance during coding our approach uses the communication history of the project the developer s mailing list in addition to usual source code history we also present results which show the practical potential of our approach copyright 2010 acm distributed software development expert recommender system global software

semantic and interaction history and proposing software design recommendations based on component interface intersecting the wehelp reference architecture for community driven recommender systems recommender systems have become increasingly popular most research on recommender systems has focused on recommendation algorithms there has been relatively little research however in the area of generalized system architectures for recommendation systems in this paper we introduce wehelp a reference architecture for social recommender systems our architecture is designed to be application and domain agnostic but we briey discuss here how it applies to recommender systems for software engineering copyright 2010 acm recommender systems reference architecture proposing software design recommendations based on component interface intersecting the open source movement had a tremendous impact on software engineering in recent years it not only established serious competition for many commercial software vendors it also led to the availability of millions of source code artifacts on the internet for the time being there exists a fledgling community working on software search solutions and associated recommendation engines however the potential for reusing knowledge contained in internet scale software repositories is far from being exhausted while existing systems are limited to retrieving existing artifacts during the coding phase in this position paper we propose a novel idea for determining the intersection of multiple similar artifacts that allows creating design recommendations for a developer even earlier in the development lifecycle case tools data mining design recommendation software reuse kadvice infering synchronization patterns from an existing codebase operating system kernels are complex software systems the kernels of todays mainstream oss such as linux or windows are composed from a number of modules which contain code and data even when providing synchronous interfaces apis to the programmer large portions of the os kernel operate in an asynchronous manner synchronizing access to kernel data structures therefore is a central problem in os kernels running on todays multicore and multiprocessor hardware with the need to utilize future multi and manycore processors managing the synchronization problem becomes central to all multithreaded control parallel applications since only little software is written from scratch understanding the intended use of locking constructs and their relation to shared data structures will become critical to all programmers built upon our experiences with developing code inside the windows kernel we have developed the kadvice approach which helps to analyze locking structures in an existing code base kadvice applies static analysis to call graphs and code dependencies to recommend appropriate locking patterns when accessing certain data structures kadvice has itself proven very useful in context of students programming projects based upon the windows research kernel wrk however our approach is more general and applicable not only to os kernels but to control parallel software in general data flow analysis kadvice lock patterns towards improved security criteria for certification of electronic health record systems the certification commission for health

implementation bugs in an open source healthcare it application we performed an initial evaluation of an open source electronic health record system openemr using an automated static analysis tool and a penetration testing tool we were able to discover implementation bugs latent in the application ranging from cross site scripting to insecure cryptographic algorithms our findings stress the importance that certification security criteria should focus on implementation bugs as well as design flaws based upon our findings we recommend that cchit be augmented with a set of misuse cases that check for specific threats against emr systems and thereby improve this aspect of the certification process copyright 2010 acm cchit ehr healthcare penetration testing security software quality static

for billions of dollars lost to industry but can cause lethal accidents although there has been much research into predicting such failures those predictions usually concentrate either on the

software development teams to show that both authorship and interaction information about how a developer interacts with the code are important in characterizing a developer s knowledge of code we introduce the degree of knowledge model that computes automatically a real value for each source code element based on both authorship and interaction information we show that the degree of knowledge

and the newly emerging federal segment architecture methodology fsam was used to develop and refine a high level architectural framework for a public health grid infrastructure results the authors were successful in documenting a robust high level architectural framework for a phgrid the documentation generated provided a level of granularity needed to validate the proposal and included examples of both information standards and services to be implemented both the results of the pocs as well as feedback from selected public health partners were used to develop the granular documentation conclusions a robust high level cohesive architectural framework for a public health grid phgrid has been successfully articulated with its feasibility demonstrated via multiple pocs in

skills at engineering software systems in particular the paper discusses the role of formal methods within the process of developing software systems and shows that both practically and pedagogically it is important that students use at least some elements of formal methods in their earliest attempts at developing systems from this it is shown that these basic elements of the methods need to be

to be changed alongside the entities currently being changed to evaluate their accuracy current change prediction approaches use data from versioning systems such as cvs or svn these data sources provide a coarse grained view of the development history that flattens the sequence of changes in a single commit they are thus not a valid basis for evaluation in the case of developmentstyle prediction where the order of the predictions has to match the order of the changes a developer makes we propose a benchmark for the evaluation of change prediction approaches based on fine grained change data recorded from ide usage moreover the change prediction approaches themselves can use the more accurate data to fine tune their prediction we present an evaluation procedure and use it on

empirical study investigating the effect that structural complexity has on the understandability of one particular type of uml model i e the statechart diagram based on data collected in a family of three experiments we have identified three dimensions of structural complexity that affect understandability i the size and control flow complexity of the statechart in terms of features such as the number of states events guards and state transitions ii the actions that are performed when entering or leaving a state iii the sequence of actions that is performed while staying within a state based on these structural complexity dimensions we have built an understandability prediction model using a regression technique that is specifically recommended for data obtained through a repeated

recommendations for it system re engineering both aiming at a safer and more efficient work situation methods standard ethnographic methods were used to support the analysis of the current work system and work situations coupled with cognitive task analysis methods and documents review usability inspection heuristic evaluation and both in lab simulated tasks and on site real tasks usability tests were performed for the evaluation of the cpoe candidate adapted software engineering models were used in combination with usual textual descriptions tasks models and mock ups to support the recommendations for work and product re design results the analysis of the work situations identified different work organisations and procedures across the hospital s departments the most important differences concerned the doctor nurse communications and cooperation modes and the procedures for preparing and administering the medications the assessment of the medication cpoe functions uncovered a number of usability problems including severe ones leading to impossible to detect or to catch errors models of the actual and possible distribution of tasks and roles were used to support decision making in the work design process the results of the usability assessment were translated into requirements to support the necessary re engineering of the it application conclusion the hfe approach to medication cpoe efficiently identifies and distinguishes currently unsafe or uncomfortable work situations that could obviously benefit from an it solution from other work situations incorporating efficient work procedures that might be impaired by the implementation of the cpoe in this context a careful redesign of the work situation and of the entire work system is necessary to actually

many companies started global software engineering gse to benefit from cheaper faster and better development of software systems products and services however empirical studies indicate that achieving these benefits is not an easy task here we report our findings from investigating empirical evidence in gse related research literature by conducting a systematic review we observe that the gse field is still immature the amount of empirical studies is relatively small the majority of the studies represent problem oriented reports focusing on different aspects of gse management rather than in depth analysis of solutions for example in terms of useful practices or techniques companies are still driven by cost reduction strategies and at the same time the most frequently discussed recommendations indicate a necessity of investments in travelling and socialization thus at the same time as development goes global there is an ambition to minimize geographical temporal and cultural

they are becoming more prevalent in the domain of engineering design the task of creating new ontologies manually is not only tedious and cumbersome but also time consuming and expensive research aimed at addressing these problems in creating ontologies has investigated methods of automating ontology reuse mainly by extracting smaller application ontologies from larger more general purpose ontologies motivated by the wide variety of existing learning algorithms this paper describes a new approach focused on the reuse of domain specific ontologies the approach integrates existing software tools for natural language processing with new algorithms for pruning concepts not relevant to the new domain and extending the pruned ontology by adding relevant concepts the approach is assessed experimentally by automatically adapting a design rationale ontology for the software engineering domain to a new one for the related domain of engineering design the experiment produced an ontology that exhibits comparable quality to previous attempts to automate ontology creation as measured by standard content performance metrics such as coverage accuracy precision and recall however further analysis of the ontology suggests that the automated approach should be augmented with recommendations presented to a domain expert who monitors the pruning and extending processes in order to

of the social networking services are website centered and can transcend the blog website frame extending social networks into im rss and sms these social networking services provide a variety of ways for users to connect and interact arguably the defining characteristic of social networking services is a recommendation system based on trust social networking software attempts to enable the sharing of judgment and depends on the trust metrics and the model for using those metrics advogato is not the only social networking service addressing the interests of software developers social networking provides the opportunity to develop software for social networking using fuzzy lists for playlist management the increasing popularity of music recommendation systems and the recent growth of online music communities further emphasizes the need for effective playlist management tools able to create share and personalize playlists this paper proposes the development of generic playlists and presents a concrete scenario to illustrate their possibilities additionally to enable the development of playlist management tools a formal foundation is provided therefore the concept of fuzzy lists is defined and a corresponding algebra is developed fuzzy lists offer a solution perfectly suited to meet the demands of playlist management springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2008 a comparison of pair versus solo programming under different objectives an analytical approach this study compares the performances of pair development an approach in which a pair of developers jointly work on the same piece of code solo development and mixed development under two separate objectives effort minimization and time minimization to this end we develop analytical models to optimize module developer assignments in each of these approaches these models are shown to be strongly np hard and solved using a genetic algorithm the solo and pair development approaches are compared for a variety of problem instances to highlight project characteristics that favor one of the two practices we also propose a simple criterion that can reliably recommend the appropriate approach for a given problem instance typically for efficient knowledge sharing between developers or for highly connected systems the pair programming approach is preferable also the pair approach is better at leveraging expertise by pairing experts with less skilled partners solo programming is usually desirable if the system is large or the effort needed either to form a pair or to code efficiently in pairs is high solo programming is also appropriate for projects with a tight deadline whereas the reverse is true for projects with a lenient deadline the mixed approach i e an approach where both the solo and pair practices are used in the same project is only indicated when the system consists of groups of modules that are sufficiently different from one another 2008 informs extreme programming genetic

significant resources the ability to measure progress in verification is critical to assess whether resources are being applied appropriately additionally potential users need to know what fraction of the software has been order verified in this study the procedures and progress measures presented by knupp et al measuring progress order verification within software development projects engineering with computers appears in this issue 2007 are demonstrated on the premo software which simulates compressible aerodynamics through and around general geometries premo was selected for this demonstration because extensive order verification tests have been previously performed yet no systematic effort has been made to assess test suite completeness or progress this effort was performed to identify the practical issues encountered when attempting to apply the ideas by knupp measuring progress order verification within software development projects engineering with computers appears in this issue 2007 to existing production quality software in this work a non specific order verification exercise is considered as opposed to an application specific order verification exercise since past and present premo order verification efforts have been motivated by the need to verify all of the code rather than portions relevant for specific applications constructing an order verification test suite that verifies the order of accuracy of all the code capabilities is a major step in measuring progress a practical approach to test suite construction is described that helps create a complete test suite through a combination of coarse grain code coverage input keyword inspection discretization algorithm documentation and expert knowledge some of the difficulties and issues encountered during the construction of the test suite are described along with recommendations on how to deal with them once the test suite is constructed the progress measures proposed by knupp measuring progress order verification within software development projects engineering with computers appears in this issue 2007 can be evaluated and used to reconstruct the history of progress in premo verification over the past several years gaps in premo verification are identified and indicate future directions for making progress additionally a measure of premo verification fitness is computed for selected applications commonly simulated in the aerospace industry it is hoped that this demonstration will provide a practical example for other software development groups in measuring their own verification progress springer verlag london limited 2007 a case study on the application of the maaem methodology for the specification modeling of recommender systems in the legal domain

indicate knowledge of code the practice of software development can likely be improved if an externalized model of each programmer s knowledge of a particular code base is available some tools already assume a useful form of such a model can be created from data collected during development such as expertise recommenders that use information about who has changed each file to suggest who might answer questions about particular parts of a system in this paper we report on an empirical study that investigates whether a programmer s activity can be used to build a model of what a programmer knows about a code base in this study nineteen professional java programmers completed a series of questionnaires about the code on which they were working these questionnaires were generated automatically and asked about program elements a programmer had worked with frequently and recently and ones that he had not we found that a degree of interest model based on this frequency and recency of interaction can often indicate the parts of the code base for which the programmer has knowledge we also determined a number of factors that may be used to improve the model such as authorship of program elements the role of elements and the task being performed copyright 2007 acm degree of interest interaction program structure structural knowledge human interface and the

presents a comparative study of building integrated photovoltaic bipv application on typical commercial buildings in new york city and beijing these two cities have similar solar resource the analysis focuses on financial economic and policy issues of bipv system rooftop and curtain wall applications are considered the analysis is conducted by pv planner a software developed at the center for energy and environmental policy ceep in cooperation with the u s national renewable energy laboratory to provide simulation and financial analysis of bipv under different resources policy and financial circumstances and for a variety of technology configurations the analysis results in different economic values of the investment in u s and china we believe that the policy environments related to grid connected bipv are mainly responsible for such a difference the paper finally discusses the policies related to bipv development and recommends how china can make the bipv more economically appealing and spur its large application in leading cities socio technical self description as a means for projects of introducing computer supported cooperation the concept of socio technical self descriptions can be employed to run cscw projects where several perspectives have to be integrated in a process of decision making the decisions are related to technical as well as organizational structures and their interplay current approaches do not sufficiently match the challenge to facilitate the communication processes during cscw projects the alignment of software development and configuration on the one hand with organizational changes and regulations on the other hand need specific forms of documentation which can be considered as a kind of self description in this paper we explain how semi structured diagrams can fulfill these requirements if they are embedded in appropriately facilitated communication processes we provide guidelines and recommendations which were derived from several case studies and were refined during a project which planned to support the cooperation between truck drivers and dispatches by using mobile pocketpcs 2007 ieee choosing cad tools for the 21st century in the early 1980 s the use of three dimensional computer aided design cad within shipbuilding and many other industries was evolving as the preferred tool to deliver the required bill of materials bom and paper drawings to support the downstream business it was during this period that many companies were evaluating and subsequently implementing cad systems for the first time choosing the right tool was not without risk in a market that was in its infancy and where there were few cad systems available the choice between domain specific applications immmature in their multi discipline capability and mature generic cad applications was fairly straightforward as a result any specific domain requirements would not be naturally included in the core product by the software vendor necessitating significant bespoke vendor and inhouse development over time enthusiasm to perceivably optimise the capability of the toolset by developing such functionality resulted in a significant overhead in software development interface management support and training in addition any new revisions to core software resulted in costly and time consuming testing and upgrading the flexibility and agility of a business to adapt rapidly to change was therefore compromised since the 80 s there has been a marked evolution in the cad market place and the earlier immature systems have now developed and incorporated the multi disciplinary capability previously missing in 2005 bae systems submarines and surface fleet solutions commissioned an evaluation exercise to review the market leading cad solutions used throughout the shipbuilding world and recommend a preferred tool to take the business forward into the 21st century the business drivers selection process findings and lessons learnt detailed in this document explain the methodolgy applied to ultimately identify foran supplied by a spanish company named sener as the preferred cad tool to take the business into the future on supporting educational decision s for selectivity and or development of software learning packages using artificial neural network modeling a novel approach for supporting optimality of educational decision s is presented in other wards having an optimal selection decision concerned with performance evaluation of some software learning packages considered as a challenging educational issue in practice software learning packages are applied as computer instructional aids for some specific learning program curriculum so these packages are presented as different alternatives subjected to optimal decisional choice of the best one otherwise the decision for software development of some learning package s is highly recommended this adopted decisional criterion to support educational systems is basically depends upon improvement in students performances consequently some learning parameters that are candidates for measuring effectiveness and efficiency of such packages are elected to support optimal educational decision s more specifically two parameters that measure results after learning process convergence are suggested the output learning level measuring educational achievement and the response time to fulfill some pre assigned learning level artificial neural networks anns models are adopted to simulate realistically learning processes performance as well as software learning packages evaluation and testing finally it is very interesting to declare that after running of suggested artificial neural networks models obtained results are exactly well supported by practical results obtained after educational field testing of one software learning packages presented herein as a case study computer assisted instruction decision support systems artificial neural networks modeling educational technology learning parameters software learning packages how does requirements quality relate to project success or failure

business application software development division of a company in tokyo data of requirements specification quality evaluated by software quality assurance teams as well as overall project performance data in terms of cost and time overrun were available requirements specification quality data were first converted into a multiple dimensional space each dimension corresponding to an item of the recommended structure of software requirements specifications srs defined in ieee std 830 1998 we applied various statistical analysis techniques over the srs quality data and project outcomes some interesting relations between requirements quality and project success or failure were found including 1 a relatively small set of srs items have strong impact on project success or failure 2 descriptions of srs in normal projects tend to be balanced 3 srs descriptions in section 1 where purpose overview and general context of srs are written are rich in normal projects and poor in overrun projects 4 when the descriptions of srs section 1 are poor white those of functions and product perspective are rich the project tends to result in a cost overrun 2007 ieee involving users to improve the level of their satisfaction from a software product designed for public organization software applications are full of promise to improve activities in public organizations like public administration hospitals social insurances judiciary emergency services etc however results are often far away from users expectations it is a regular case so far that an inquirer may apply immediately for something but he she receives a correct document in three months there are many reasons of that one of them is a domination of rigorous hard methodologies in software companies focused on making software process fast and repeatable those methodologies developed to produce software for military applications control devices and mobile communication don t work in the case of software systems for public organizations first of all an isolation of software developers from its users results in a low level of users satisfaction from a software product poor quality of software has its roots in the basic principle of the today s economy the high productivity is a measure of success also in a software production a concentration on particular functions instead of entire business processes also underlies wrong software solutions so yesterday s solutions are transferred into an information system besides that software developers make a wrong assumption that end users are a homogenous group of people who work always perfectly in fact a lot of failures arise because of the mistaken data recorded in documents and databases so called noisy texts are the current field of research 22 furthermore too optimistic estimations concern migrations and transfers of data the problem is how to build in quality into software systems developed for governmental and other public organizations the change of technology in a public organization should be oriented to its mission which is superior to profitability of supporting tools this mission is to provide and improve specified services for citizens who are indirect users of a software product the software system should be designed along with a new technology and its every day usage there is a lack of specified processes of cooperation with users the level of users satisfaction from a software product is assumed the main measure of software quality in the presented uid user involved development approach 10 which incorporates techniques derived both from hard and soft methodologies the aim is to improve the level of average user s satisfaction to provide it users should leave peripheries of the software process and become its subject 11 the direct and indirect users are supposed to cooperate with designers to improve software quality soft methodologies include users involvement see section 2 but their share in the software production still remains slight on the other hand there is no escape from technical standards and rules of economy market the idea of the uid derives partially from the author s experience with poor software quality and it is also a result of research concerning software quality including quality assessment many of the polled respondents show their willingness to influence on a software product 7 users take part in the specified primary and supporting processes of the uid approach the specified infrastructure is required to realize those processes developers assume that the detailed requirements are obtainable at the beginning of a product life cycle they believe that a specification of requirements including quality attributes is sufficient to provide software quality in the real life never ending improvements are added to the software system an essential feature of the uid approach is a permanent feedback from users on a software product see section 5 this approach has been applied first to the evolutional development of software supporting specified calculations in civil engineering after four iterations of the collaborative development including periodical assessment of software quality 8 the level of users satisfaction from a product is much better than that at the beginning despite all differences between the software applied by civil engineers and those used in public organizations the idea to incorporate direct and also indirect users in the software process is worth working out the quality aspects are mainly focused on the usability of a product assessed from the users point of view examples of quality measures are given in the section 6 people factors are usually reduced to the management of human resources in a software factory 15 16 27 users differ from developers in age gender skills and personalities examinations in four organizations showed that 56 of users were females in the 40 to 50 age bracket 7 while software factories are dominated by men under 35 the competency management in software companies should be reoriented to develop competencies which enable cooperation with users the described approach is complementary to the recommended mda model driven architecture 24 program authors and software users together are creators of models of future software solutions thus a set of competencies required in software production should also include capabilities to cooperate with people of various profession age culture and gender towards social network based approach for software engineering ontology sharing and evolution in this paper we present a multi agent social network approach that integrates the software engineering ontology and expert recommendation facilities for communities of software engineers remotely working on related software engineering projects the software engineering ontology enables an active ecology of agents to convey consume and act on project information semi

to developing e learning software solutions the research is proposing a new way of tackling the process of creation of e learning solutions as interactive environments by integrating and undertaking the software engineering approach based on e learning indicators the study proposes and recommends as starting point in any e learning initiative assessment measurement and evaluation of concepts and factors that influence e learning further represented as e learning indicators the main research was focused towards software engineering 3 three different e learning interactive environments based on e learning indicators approach taking into consideration theories of learning and pedagogical approach in their development the main focus was set on assessing and evaluating the e learning indicators and based on them designing and building the e learning software solutions in order to further analyze issues and propose solutions several e learning software solutions are designed and build and further analyzed as case study experiments also a methodology for evaluation of the e learning effectiveness is also proposed and assessed this research makes several contributions first it proposes a new development methodology called e learning indicators methodology approach to creation of e learning software solutions secondly it proposes an assessment and evaluation novel methodology called eluat e learning usability attributes testing and as measuring instrument the pet predefined evaluation tasks inspection technique and gives insights and evaluation of their usage thirdly it investigates different learning approaches 1 the content oriented 2 the tool oriented and the 3 task oriented approach and analyses of these models in supporting project problem and task based learning e learning effectiveness engineering indicators software solutions revitalizing software engineering education in the 21 sup st sup century the shared software infrastructure program ssip model is recommended to serve as the national model to revitalize u s undergraduate education in the 21 st century the model has proven effective in inserting advanced solutions from industry into undergraduate education programs to increase the employability of u s undergraduates ssip can close the gap between what is taught in u s undergraduate programs and what industry expects of a university graduate the ssip model assumes that an undergraduate student owns a client computer that can be connected to the internet the ssip website called the ssi hub has servers that can be used by member universities to support classroom instruction the servers are supplied by industrial sponsors system support staff for setting up the servers and maintaining software systems is located at the ssi hub member universities avoid the need to hire expensive systems staff internet based distance learning techniques are used to introduce the latest software solutions into classrooms the initial effort created the first version of the ssi hub which provided undergraduate students with the most advanced infrastructure to support capstone team projects the ssip model can be used to introduce advanced software solutions into both undergraduate and graduate classrooms personalized links recommendation based on data mining in adaptive educational hypermedia systems in this paper we describe a personalized recommender system that uses web mining techniques for recommending a student which next links to visit within an adaptable educational hypermedia system we present a specific mining tool and a recommender engine that we have integrated in the aha system in order to help the teacher to carry out the whole web mining process we report on several experiments with real data in order to show the suitability of using both clustering and sequential pattern mining algorithms together for discovering personalized recommendation links springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2007 a fully automated recommender system using collaborative filters recommender systems represent valuable marketing tools in e commerce no wonder that this field has enjoyed quite some attention from the scientific community that seeks to develop algorithms that optimize the performance of recommender systems based on the analysis of historical data in the research reported here we experimented with a mechanism that combines traditional collaborative filtering approaches with explicit rating this paper describes the technique and illustrates its behavior in a test bed we created from real world data the results are promising collaborative filtering internet tools recommender systems user profile commandments of uml for safety nowadays the unified modeling language uml is becoming a de facto standard for object oriented environments and then it is perceived as a part of the culture of software engineers however the luck of rigorous semantic basis is a great shortcoming of uml which upsets its use to address safety problems still taking benefit of the richness of uml to model critical systems is worthwhile because it is aimed at reducing the certification effort required for the design phase currently we undertake works to delimit a well defined uml core which could be used to model such systems in this paper we explore some critical aspects and recommendations of basic uml constructs which should be approached when dealing with safety 2007 ieee implementation compilation optimization of object oriented languages programs and systems icooolps 2006 was the first edition of ecoop icooolps workshop it intended to bring researchers and practitioners both from academia and industry together with a spirit of openness to try and identify and begin to address the numerous and very varied issues of optimization this succeeded as can be seen from the papers the attendance and the liveliness of the discussions that took place during and after the workshop not to mention a few new cooperations or postdoctoral contracts the 22 talented people from different groups who participated were unanimous to appreciate this first edition and recommend that icooolps be continued next year a community is thus beginning to form and should be reinforced by a second edition next year with all the improvements this first edition made emerge springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2007 software engineering e learning dictionary of computer science terms and nomenclatures the research reports qualitative research studies focused on designing and developing e learning dictionary of computer science terms and nomenclatures undertaking a didactical pedagogical approach the main research was focused towards creating an e learning dictionary system and its assessment of e learning effectiveness motivation of the research is to avoid inconsistencies and language problems regarding translation of such terms and nomenclatures in literature textbooks and articles by providing a community of experts by invitation that will create an official and standardized translations the authenticated users with administrative privileges will add store and change and overall manage the e learning dictionary the primary administrator will grant administrative or reader privileges to learners based on authentication this kind of approach is based on wild approach by creating a community of users where unlike the wiki approach will be carefully chosen and granted approach by invitation and privileges will be based on user data validation the research method was exploratory research to determine the best research design and then empirical research to describe accurately the interaction between the learners and the system being observed the data were collected through focus groups and surveys direct or indirect discussions and in depth communications and interviews with prospective users as well as with literature review of the experts in the field we have used the pedagogical re engineering process that we consider as important to be able to compare the effective system usage with prescribed scenario the purpose of the research realized is in order 1 to gather information and asses e learning interactions between human actors and the developed medium of instruction the software solution 2 determine the distance between learner activities and preconceived scenarios the observed route of a learner was used to give feedback information on the effective learning this research gives valuable insight into evaluated e learning impact of the online dictionary practical issues and recommendations secondly contributes in standardizing translation of computer science terms and nomenclature in other languages other then in english by providing an interactive interface and community willing to contribute dictionary e learning effectiveness engineering indicators solution using motsart to support on line teachers in student motivation in classrooms teachers know how to motivate their students and exploit this knowledge to adapt or optimize their instruction when a student shows signs of demotivation in on line learning environments it is much more difficult to assess the motivation of the student and to have adaptive intervention strategies and rules of application to help prevent attrition we developed motsart a motivational strategies recommender tool to support on line teachers in motivating learners the design is informed by social cognitive theory and a survey on motivation intervention strategies carried out with sixty on line teachers the survey results were analysed using a data mining algorithm j48 decision trees which resulted in a set of decision rules for recommending motivational strategies motsart has been developed based on these decision rules its functionality enables the teacher to specify the learner s motivation profile motsart then recommends the most likely intervention strategies to increase motivation springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2007 goal orientation intervention strategies locus of control motivation on line learning on line teachers perceived task difficulty recommender tool self efficacy recommending random walks we improve on previous recommender systems by taking advantage of the layered structure of software we use a random walk approach mimicking the more focused behavior of a developer who browses the caller callee links in the callgraph of a large program seeking routines that are likely to be related to a function of interest inspired by kleinberg s work 10 we approximate the steady state of an infi nite random walk on a subset of a callgraph in order to rank the functions by their steady state probabilities surprisingly this purely structural approach works quite well our approach like that of robillard s suade algorithm 15 and earlier data mining approaches 13 relies solely on the always available current state of the code rather than other sources such as comments documentation or revision information using the apache api documentation as an oracle we perform a quantitative evaluation of our method finding that our algorithm dramatically improves upon suade in this setting we also find that the performance of traditional data mining approaches is complementary to ours this leads naturally to an evidence based combination of the two which shows excellent performance on this task copyright 2007 acm graph theory recommender systems achieving managerial goals in business process components design using genetic algorithms business process modelling is a tool for requirements engineers or business analysts to express business requirements in terms of what activities are to take place when the application software executes since business process models can be shared by different organisations or business domains we can apply the concept of software component fabrication to the fabrication of process components a business process model will be partitioned into subprocesses each of which is a process component that may be used as part of other business process models this paper proposes an approach to designing process components by using a genetic algorithm based on a fitness function the approach can give a recommendation for a process components design that optimally achieves managerial goals i e cost effectiveness ease of assembly

to help users find items that they deem of interest to them they can be seen as an application of data mining process in this paper a new recommender system based on multi features is introduced demographic and psychographic features are used to asses similarities between users the model is built on a collaborative filtering method and addresses three problems sparsity scalability and cold star the sparsity problem is tackled by integrating users documents relevant information within meta clusters the scalability and the cold start problems are considered by using a suitable probability model calculated on meta cluster information moreover a weight similarity measure is introduced in order to take into account dynamic human being preferences behaviour a prediction score for generating recommendations is proposed based on the target user previous behaviour and his her neighbourhood preferences on the target document springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2007 collaborative

research on methods for evaluating the accessibility conformance level of software and especially operating systems our approach is based on recommendations from software accessibility standards and defines techniques for evaluating each of those recommendations the proposed method has been applied to evaluate the accessibility features of one closed source and one open source desktop operating system microsoft windows xp and the ubuntu linux distribution respectively specifically the functionality we have evaluated was task management and file system management from the point of view of the evaluation process we conclude that more work is needed on the development of support tools and techniques and from the point of view of the specific comparison we conclude that taking into account the analysed functionality the current version of the ubuntu linux distribution is slightly more accessible than the current windows release though neither of the systems fully conform to the accessibility standards springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2007 effective preparation for design review using uml arrow checklist leveraged on the gurus knowledge the process of design construction and design review is notorious in its endless debates and discussions sometimes these gurus style debates are triggered by simple mistakes that could have been easily avoided precious time is lost both because of the designer s lack of experience and the reviewer s overconfidence if both sides were effectively prepared and armed with the same ammunition of knowledge the balance of terror would reduce the will to argue and focus would be maintained reinforcing the abilities to face the intimidating guru s knowledge can be by formal encapsulation of that knowledge and systematic gurus guidance to the design steps this paper presents a methodology that captures the recommended selection of entities relationships using uml notation the uml arrow methodology is comprised of a checklist which provides immediate yes no feedback to simple guiding questions and a governing iterative process the consolidated questions encompass best practice design methodologies composed edited and corroborated by the company s experienced designers it contains a common process based on capturing the gurus recommendations according to the company s specific needs the methodology was evaluated in practitioners workshops as well as practical design sessions based on data received through questionnaires the results obtained from 62 participants reveal that 1 usage of this methodology led to effective identification of inappropriate entities relationships 2 shortened the design review duration 3 removed redundant technical remarks 4 improved the preparation stages as well as brainstorming sessions and 4 overall maintained a focused discussions regarding the problem design review modeling object oriented design refactoring software engineering methodology uml a

related disciplines and is being run by a joint task force from several professional societies with acm taking the lead the goals of the project are to provide a union of all that is computing and various ways of organizing and visualiz ing the breadth and depth of the combined computing and information related disciplines this project began in late 2003 and got started in earnest in early 2004 the project has produced a reasonably comprehensive list of topic areas that make up the combined disciplines and a representation of the associations between those topic areas the work was presented in a preliminary form at sigcse 2005 and was the subject of an iticse 2005 working group the sigcse session and the working group generated a good deal of comment and interest the work has progressed

user population which does not consist only of oss developers anymore in this type of oss development the naïve non computer professional users should be taken into account and usability of oss improved furthermore software quality becomes a very relevant issue to be assured we contrast oss literature on quality and usability with prescriptive literatures derived from the fields of software engineering and human computer interaction we present a summary of the current practices utilized to assure quality and usability in oss development and recommend practices to be used in this context we also point out limitations in the existing research and suggest paths for future work 2007 ieee contextualising design aspects of using usability context analysis and hierarchical task analysis for software design usability context analysis is part of iso 9241 11 and as such is recommended for use in user centred design however studies involving a critical assessment of usability context analysis within the software domain are scarce this paper details two small studies that involved the use of usability context analysis uca and hierarchical task analysis hta the first system involved designing a small subsite of a larger website while the second system was a small database designed as part of an exercise by uk university students post design evaluation suggested that the use of both uca and hta rather than one or the other was beneficial in gathering and analysing user requirements hierarchical task analysis small case studies software design usability context analysis large scale software engineering questions expert opinion or empirical evidence a recent report on the state of the uk information technology it industry based most of its findings and recommendations on expert opinion it is surprising that the report was unable to incorporate more empirical evidence this paper aims to assess whether it is necessary to base it industry and academic policy on expert opinion rather than on empirical evidence current evidence related to the rate of project failure is identified and the methods used to accumulate that evidence discussed this shows that the report failed to identify relevant evidence and most evidence related to project failure is based on convenience samples the status of empirical research in the computing disciplines is reviewed showing that empirical evidence covers a restricted range of subjects and seldom addresses the society level of analysis other more robust designs that would address large scale it questions are discussed we recommend adopting a more systematic approach to accumulating and reporting evidence in addition we propose using quasi experimental designs developed and used in the social sciences to improve the

to find ways of better integrating software engineering into the systems engineering and acquisition process concurrently the national research council nrc study was addressing the problem of better integrating human factors into the systems engineering and acquisition process this article presents a model that emerged from these and related efforts that shows promise of improving integrations this model called the incremental commitment model icm organizes systems engineering and acquisition processes in ways that better accommodate the different strengths and difficulties of hardware

foundation and with support from the acm education board and the ieee cs education activities board has undertaken to enumerate all of the topics related to any aspect of the computing disciplines work of the original committee was enhanced by an iticse working group in 2005 7 the motivation for this effort includes the immense scale of the task of generating new curriculum recommendations and the difficulty of describing evolving innovative computing programs for purposes of comparison or possible accreditation the project committee has surveyed lists of computing topics from sources including but not limited to the current curriculum recommendations of the acm ieee cs and ais 1 2 3 4 5 the list also includes topics extracted from the current acm computing classification scheme 6 other topic lists are incorporated as they are discovered the result is a comprehensive list of computing topics covering all of computer engineering computer science information systems information

wheeled tractor the steering system of a compact wheeled tractor is analyzed using a commercial multi body simulation software the effect of axle oscillation induced steering errors and of the axle impacting the bump stops attached to the tractor body is compared for two design variants it is shown that by diminishing the kinematic cross coupling between the steering control linkage and the axle oscillation a favorable reduction of the dynamic loads in the steering mechanism components can be obtained for normal operation conditions of the vehicle however if the axle impacts violently its bump stops the reaction forces in the joints can be much higher contrary to one s intuition these forces are larger for steering systems with reduced or no bump steer based on these conclusions

software systems developers must collaborate with each other to solve issues to facilitate this collaboration specialized tools such as chat and screen sharing are being integrated into development environments currently these tools require a developer to maintain a list of other developers with whom they may wish to communicate and to determine who within this list has expertise for a specific situation for large dynamic projects like several successful open source projects these requirements place an unreasonable burden on the developer in this paper we show how the structure of a team emerges from how developers change software artifacts we introduce the emergent expertise locator eel that uses emergent team information to propose experts to a developer within their development

matrix that is not eligible for structural analyses is converted into an eligible form is investigated a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the findings results the necessary and sufficient condition for an indecomposable real square technology matrix can be expressed using power series was identified two additional conditions for a technology matrix to be utilized for structural analyses using power series expansion are discussed as well it was also shown that an lca system that fulfills the hawkins simon condition can be easily converted into the form that is eligible for structural analysis by rescaling the columns and rows discussion as a numerical example an application of accumulative structural path analysis for an lca system is shown the implications of the results are discussed in a more plain language as well conclusions the survey presented in this paper provides not only the conditions under which a linear system is expressed using a power series form but also the way to appropriately convert a system to utilize the rich analytical tools using power series expansion for structural analyses recommendations and perspectives widely used lca databases and software tools have employed the linear systems approach as the basis much of these developments in the domain of lca have been made however in isolation of the rich findings of ioa there will be much to benefit lca through an active dialogue between the two disciplines there are rich analytical tools available through the use of power series expansion the current survey will help software developers and lca practitioners to apply such tools in lca 2007 ecomed publishers verlagsgruppe hüthig jehle rehm gmbh input output analysis ioa lca practitioners lca software

biomechanical failure criteria the research aims to carry out a detailed analysis of the loads applied by the ambulance workers when loading unloading ambulance stretchers the forces required of the ambulance workers for each system are measured using a load cell in a force handle arrangement the process of loading and unloading is video recorded for all the systems to register the posture of the ambulance workers in different stages of the process the postures and forces exerted by the ambulance workers are analyzed using biomechanical assessment software to examine if the work loads at any stage of the process are harmful kinetic analysis of each stretcher loading system is performed comparison of the kinetic analysis and measurements shows very close agreement for most of the cases the force analysis results are evaluated against derived failure criteria the evaluation is extended to a biomechanical failure analysis of the ambulance worker s lower back using 3dsspp software developed at the centre for ergonomics at the university of michigan the critical tasks of each ambulance worker during the loading and unloading operations for each system are identified design

made about those pages to members of a community as the user browses web pages recommendations of relevant documents which have already been shared are produced based upon both the user s social network as well as the semantic content of the page currently in view key to the design of the system has been the requirement evidenced by earlier studies that sharing should be easily effected as a side effect of browsing rather than comprising a separate and distracting task another feature of the system is the linkage of a formal ontology with user provided tags of shared information thus

capabilities are introduced in many application domains such as robotics the military aerospace ground vehicles it network and systems management so far descriptions of such systems are neither decomposed into common modules nor aligned to a common reference model for this reason it is hard to compare them regarding common cross domain properties of systems with self management capabilities

the views of experts on the current state of agile method tailoring as stated in the conference theme the failure of information systems and information technology projects remains stubbornly high agile methods have recently emerged as a new and seemingly popular alternative approach to systems development purveyors of these methods claim they solve many of the problems that have plagued the field for over 40 years and there is now anecdotal evidence to suggest that these benefits are being realized and that diffusion of agile methods is rapidly increasing however a key factor in the diffusion of any technology or method is its ability to be customized innovative customization tailoring and fragmentation of systems development methods are viewed by many as a necessary step to avoid project failure like so many projects in the past the ability to tailor any method is considered critically important given the complex and unique nature of each and every isd environment and in particular one would logically expect that a method labeled as agile should be malleable however it is still unclear whether agile methods are amenable to tailoring on one hand purveyors of these methods advocate and often recommend tailoring on the other hand however tailoring of agile methods has been described as a potential minefield due to the fact that their practices are interconnected synergistic and socially embedded in the development effort this study develops a better understanding of agile method tailoring in practice through semi structured delphi interviews with 40 isd expert practitioners and academics the study sought to ascertain their opinion on the tailoring of agile methods in general and then honed in on specific critical success factors csfs of tailoring namely built in contingency clear rationale behind method practices independence of method practices and disciplined and educated tailoring of practices the study found that these factors are largely ignored by the agile method movement except in rare instances and concludes with a set of recommendationsfor agile method creators and users to ensure agile methods experience higher diffusion rates

sequence to assess the correctness of application upon cots upgrades deployment various regression test selection strategies have been developed to establish the correctness of software systems upon deployment of cots upgrades these strategies recommend a smaller regression test suite to be reexecuted we present a process that identifies the patch impact on the system and localizes the source of potential errors without executing the system test suite the impact is analyzed based on verifying the behavior of affected cots api execution sequences an api executionsequence is called affected when one or more of the altered functions of the cots upgrade are part of cots api execution sequence that interfaces with application components a wrapper based passive test oracle has been developed to check the correctness of the behavior of these execution sequences the changed behavior of these execution sequences reflects the patch impact a case study has been conducted and the results are

objectives grid based technologies are emerging as potential solutions for managing and collaborating distributed resources in the biomedical domain few examples exist however of successful implementations of grid enabled medical systems and even fewer have been deployed for evaluation in practice the objective of this paper is to evaluate the use in clinical practice of a grid based imaging prototype and to establish directions for engineering future medical grid developments and their subsequent deployment method the mammogrid project has deployed a prototype system for clinicians using the grid as its information infrastructure to assist in the specification of the system requirements and for the first time in healthgrid applications use case modelling has been carried out in close collaboration with clinicians and radiologists who had no prior experience of this modelling technique a critical qualitative and where possible quantitative analysis of the mammogrid prototype is presented leading to a set of recommendations from the delivery of the first deployed grid based medical imaging application results we report critically on the application of software engineering techniques in the specification and implementation of the mammogrid project and show that use case modelling is a suitable vehicle for representing medical requirements and for communicating effectively with the clinical community this paper also discusses the practical advantages and limitations of applying the grid to real life clinical applications and presents the consequent lessons learned conclusions the work presented in this paper demonstrates that given suitable commitment from collaborating radiologists it is practical to deploy in practice medical imaging analysis applications using the grid but that standardization in and stability of the grid software is a necessary pre requisite for successful healthgrids the mammogrid prototype has therefore paved the way for further advanced grid based deployments in the medical and biomedical domains 2006 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved distributed databases grid computing medical

architecture user driven requirements elicitation method with the support of personalized domain knowledge the requirements elicitation of application software is tightly involved with the application domain and faced with many non technological issues it is more and more difficult for requirements engineers to explore and understand the problem space and to get what users really need and expect solely by traditional methods and techniques especially for those application systems that involve rich domain specific knowledge and have multiple users playing multiple roles with complex organizational structure users involvement is emphasized while users always have difficulties in delivering their requirements clearly and completely due to their vague and partial understanding of the system although the reuse of domain knowledge is helpful its effectiveness is limited by the ignorance of each user s individuality and specific local concern of the system as well as the vastness of domain knowledge besides users cooperation has not been considered enough a novel user driven requirements elicitation method is proposed based on users individualities and context support for users to present requirements is provided including the recommendation of domain assets and advice about multi user cooperation the application of the method shows the method is feasible and provides positive effects on requirements elicitation through promoting users participation and improving domain knowledge reuse domain knowledge personalization requirements elicitation user preferences user

individual organizations would be able to rely on cross company based estimation models we performed a systematic review of studies that compared predictions from cross company models with predictions from within company models based on analysis of project data ten papers compared cross company and within company estimation models however only seven presented independent results of those seven three found that cross company models were not significantly different from within company models and four found that cross company models were significantly worse than within company models experimental procedures used by the studies differed making it impossible to undertake formal meta analysis of the results the main trend distinguishing study results was that studies with small within company data sets i e ≤20 projects that used leave one out cross validation all found that the within company model was significantly different better from the cross company model the results of this review are inconclusive it is clear that some organizations would be ill served by cross company models whereas others would benefit further studies are needed but they must be independent i e based on different data bases or at least different single company data sets and should address specific hypotheses concerning the conditions that would favor cross company or within company models in addition experimenters need to standardize their experimental procedures to enable formal meta analysis and recommendations are made in section 3 2007 ieee cost estimation management software engineering systematic review model evaluation guidelines for systematic quantification of accuracy in watershed simulations watershed models are powerful tools for simulating the effect of watershed processes and management on soil and water resources however no comprehensive guidance is available to facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data compared to measured flow and constituent values thus the objectives of this research were to 1 determine recommended model evaluation techniques statistical and graphical 2 review reported ranges of values and corresponding performance ratings for the recommended statistics and 3 establish guidelines for model evaluation based on the review results and project specific considerations all of these objectives focus on simulation of streamflow and transport of sediment and nutrients these objectives were achieved with a thorough review of relevant literature on model application and recommended model evaluation methods based on this analysis we recommend that three quantitative statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr in addition to the graphical techniques be used in model evaluation the following model evaluation performance ratings were established for each recommended statistic in general model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 and rsr ≤ 0 70 and if pbias ± 25 for streamflow pbias ± 55 for sediment and pbias ± 70 for n and p for pbias constituent specific performance ratings w ere determined based on uncertainty of measured data additional considerations related to model evaluation guidelines are also discussed these considerations include single event simulation quality and quantity of measured data model calibration procedure evaluation time step and project scope and magnitude a case study illustrating the application of the model evaluation guidelines is also provided accuracy model calibration and validation simulation watershed model impact of evolution of concerns in the model driven architecture design approach separation of concerns is an important principle for designing high quality software systems and is both applied in the model driven architecture mda and aspect oriented software development aosd the aosd and mda techniques seem to be complementary to each other historically aosd has focused on modeling crosscutting concerns whereas mda has focused on the explicit separation of platform independent concerns from platform specific concerns and the model driven generation processes in order to assess the benefits of aosd for mda we provide a systematic analysis on crosscutting concerns within the mda context the analysis consists of three steps first we define an abstract model of mda transformation with respect to concerns second we define a number of evolution scenarios that correspond to a selected list of crosscutting concerns third we analyze the model transformations in mda with respect to the abstract model the evolution scenarios and the related crosscutting concerns this analysis results in the definition of a number of key problems related to the integration and evolution of crosscutting concerns in the mda approach based on this analysis we provide a set of recommendations for the language and the process that is used in the mda approach 2007 elsevier b v all rights reserved crosscutting concern evolution mda is abstraction the key to computing some recommendations for the future work of abstraction and its role in computing are presented abstraction is important in computer science and software engineering and involves identification of critical aspects of the environment and the required system the generalization aspect of abstraction is seen in the programming with the use of data abstractions and object oriented programming abstract analysis for program analysis is another example of generalization where the concrete program domain is mapped to an abstract domain to capture the semantics of the computation of the program analysis abstraction skills are essential in the construction of appropriate models designs and implementation fit for the particular purpose and analysis of the programs in a programming language abstraction is a fundamental to mathematics and engineering playing a important part in the production of models and sound engineering solutions controller area network can schedulability analysis refuted revisited and revised controller area network can is used extensively in automotive applications with in excess of 400 million can enabled microcontrollers manufactured each year in 1994 schedulability analysis was developed for can showing how worst case response times of can messages could be calculated and hence guarantees provided that message response times would not exceed their deadlines this seminal research has been cited in over 200 subsequent papers and transferred to industry in the form of commercial can schedulability analysis tools these tools have been used by a large number of major automotive manufacturers in the design of in vehicle networks for a wide range of cars millions of which have been manufactured during the last decade this paper shows that the original schedulability analysis given for can messages is flawed it may provide guarantees for messages that will in fact miss their deadlines in the worst case this paper provides revised analysis resolving the problems with the original approach further it highlights that the priority assignment policy previously claimed to be optimal for can is not in fact optimal and cites a method of obtaining an optimal priority ordering

analysis schedulability analysis strategic information systems planning a case study from the financial services industry strategic information systems planning sisp is an important topic for managers and researchers alike however there is evidence of a gap between sisp research and practice taking this situation as a motivation we conducted an in depth case study on sisp to investigate this gap the study was carried out in a german financial services company fsc over a period of five months in summer 2003 during this time the enterprise situation and the information system is practices situation of fsc were studied with respect to the sisp approach in place our findings confirm the hypothesis that practitioners largely ignore academic literature and do not use it in support of their sisp endeavours this is all the more striking since fsc extensively used guidance from is research in other fields such as systems analysis and software development our case study examines in detail two possible explanations for the gap firstly a lacking transfer of academic knowledge to practice and secondly deficiencies in the academic knowledge base itself in fact our observations highlight a disconnect between academic discussion and practical conduct however we found that the ignorance of academic literature on sisp is not primarily caused by a constrained knowledge transfer in order to exclude communication barriers we filtered the academic discussion according to the specific situation and the needs of fsc and translated it into practical recommendations nevertheless the academic arguments we put forward hardly had any impact either on it managers thinking or on sisp practice at fsc though academic literature was partly perceived as inspiring it was not regarded as a touchstone for sisp practice academia in the eyes of fsc s practitioners ignores the real problems and thus is not accredited as a relevant source of advice moreover in a final discussion with fsc s senior it executives we got the impression that the professional identity of fsc s it management and more specifically the cio s role was different from interpretations prevalent in academia the academic discussion assumes the cio to be an initiator of organisational innovations and driver of business strategy on the board in contrast we found that fsc s cio basically perceives her role as that of a service provider to business while the different perceptions might be due to idiosyncrasies of fsc related research provided additional empirical support for the conjecture of misleading academic assumptions about the role of it management in practice 2007 elsevier b v all rights reserved the esmaf a software for the assessment and follow up of functional autonomy in geriatrics background functional status or disability forms the core of most assessment instruments used to identify mix and level of resources and services needed by older adults who possess common characteristics the functional autonomy measurement system smaf is a 29 item scale measuring functional ability in five different areas it has been recommended for use for home care for allocation of chronic beds for developing care plans in institutional settings and for epidemiological and evaluative studies the smaf can also be used with a case mix classification system iso smaf to allocate

software life cycle that prevents patent infringements the more offensive patent based software life cycle that aims both at preventing infringements and at creating new patents and the ipr based software life cycle that considers all forms of protection of intellectual property rights including copyright and secrecy next we study an application for a software patent concerning the inequality

the software life cycle in an extensive discussion we cover the difference between expression and idea the role of patent claims software patents versus computer implemented inventions the role of prior art implications of software patents for open source software for education and for government funded research we conclude the discussion with the formulation of an integrity axiom for software patent authors and owners and sketch an agenda for software patent research we conclude that patents are too important to be left to lawyers and economists and that a complete reinterpretation of the

decisions rules osiri was designed to provide farmers with targeted advices on discrete units of irrigation and for simulating scenarios of irrigation systems to optimize their performance an optional procedure of direct adjustment by farmers and a system of controlled irrigation rationing are proposed to meet the producer needs the number of input parameters is adapted to the rather limited data availability and the recommendation sheet is user friendly oriented field data confirmed that osiri simulates very reasonably well actual evapotranspiration and drainage below the sugarcane root zone also osiri allowed to save about 30 of irrigation delivery on a 140 day period as compared to the currently used crop water requirement method respectively 165 and 240 mm of water without significant decrease in yield respectively 102 and 101 t ha 1 2006 elsevier b v all rights reserved field measurements irrigation monitoring irrigation scheduling reunion island france soil water balance simulation model sugarcane enhanced context analysis for extreme programming xp describing the big picture any computing system operates in and provides support for a particular environment the importance of conducting an appropriate analysis of that environment or context is frequently stressed despite this it is often overlooked in the development of many computing systems agile approaches to software development recognise this weakness emphasising the need for closer customer collaboration essentially a customer representative is responsible for providing the required knowledge of the environment nevertheless problems remain with many difficulties reported for the customer role the recent version of extreme programming xp the most popular agile approach acknowledges this with new practices recommending consideration of the broader context taking account of the big picture despite this little advice is given on how this might be implemented this paper examines how this might be achieved by streamlining soft systems methodology ssm a well established analysis technique and linking it with xp the first part of this paper describes the linked approach this is then followed by a report on an investigation of the approach that has been assessed through experimental group projects with undergraduate computing students the results highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses of the linkage indicating directions for future research extreme programming rich picture soft systems methodology a systematic review of software development cost estimation studies this paper aims to provide a basis for the improvement of software estimation research through a systematic review of previous work the review identifies 304 software cost estimation papers in 76 journals and classifies the papers according to research topic estimation approach research approach study context and data set a web based library of these cost estimation papers is provided to ease the identification of relevant estimation research results the review results combined with other knowledge provide support for recommendations for future software cost estimation research including 1 increase the breadth of the search for relevant studies 2 search manually for relevant papers within a carefully selected set of journals when completeness is essential 3 conduct more studies on

massachusetts contract by systems modelling a case study on the fda principles of software validation certification has been a concern amongst the software engineering community for the past few decades and is becoming a major concern today several organisations in charge of certification have published guidance documents to describe this crucial activity indeed these organisations through their documents aim to establish a common understanding between software producers and certifiers evaluators these guidance documents use natural language in specifying recommendations because of the wide audience to which they are addressed and the consequent need for simplicity however the specification is not sufficiently explicit and precise to be able to impose a contract obligation between the two parties in this paper we illustrate this problem as it appears in the guidance documents published by the us food and drug administration fda to validate medical device software by bearing in mind the clear distinction between products and processes we use the product process p p method to model the quality planning activity of the fda validation approach by using p p modelling we present a simplified representation for the fda validation activities in essence the p p methodology takes a general systems approach it is appropriate to a variety of areas and has proven its applicability in many fields medical software certification process product evaluation software validation systems modelling a general model of software architecture design derived from five industrial approaches we compare five industrial software architecture design methods and we extract from their commonalities a general software architecture design approach using this general approach we compare across the five methods the artifacts and activities they use or recommend and we pinpoint similarities and differences once we get beyond the great variance in terminology and description we find that the five approaches have a lot in common and match more or less the ideal pattern we introduced from the ideal pattern we derive an evaluation grid that can be used for further method comparisons 2006

software firms through physical systems knowledge and skills managerial system and value and norm aspects before and after they introduce cmmi by conducting qualitative based multiple case study approach and using semi structural questionnaire as the tool we identified cmmi related organization routines grounding on these routines we integrate capabilities competencies related literatures and value co production studies to propose a co evolution model which suggest that capabilities competencies of software companies come from the co evolution between organizational standard operation procedures sops and customer projects the co evolution model would be useful to supplement the dynamic capabilities theory of firm from the value co production viewpoint further it is analyzed whether these capabilities can become the strategic assets of the software firms finally we recommend that the introduction of cmmi is not only the behavior for taiwan software firms to build their competitive advantage without differences but also to build a high performance mechanism for co producing value with their customers 2007 taylor francis group llc capabilities cmmi competencies

the temperature monitoring of a post tensioned segmental concrete box girder bridge this article describes the development and implementation of a computer based remote monitoring system for the temperature monitoring of an 11 span segmental post tensioned concrete box girder bridge monitoring has been carried out for 5 years the extensive data collected is analyzed using software that has been developed to provide engineers with information that can be used in the evaluation of the long term behavior and performance of the bridge the software has been used to determine the maximum and the minimum bridge temperatures the vertical temperature differences through the bridge cross section and the horizontal temperature differences in the transverse directions comparisons have been made with design specification provisions and with recommendations proposed by previous researchers in addition software has been developed to determine the relationship between the daily maximum temperature differences and the air temperatures inside the box girder this approach is also used to develop the relationship between the maximum stresses due to temperature differences and the air temperature inside the box girder this article shows the benefits from using a computer based monitoring system to provide a continuous evaluation of data collected on the bridge 2007 computer aided civil and infrastructure engineering mentor graphics systemvision software curriculum integration dynamic system complexity is growing rapidly creating the need for more powerful and complex control system design it can be difficult to ensure that all students working within control system and mechatronic curricula develop an in depth and complete understanding of the interaction between complex mechatronic systems and the control systems required to stabilize and optimize their behavior due to this increase in system complexity the need for time efficient yet accurate simulation and experimentation has become essential in dynamic system and control system design and development unfortunately class sizes and lecture schedules have responded inversely and increased the difficultly in ensuring students have the breadth and depth of system analysis and control theory understanding and experience required of them by a demanding industry mentor graphics system vision software can improve the understanding and application of control theory as well as complex dynamic system behavior in a reduced or compressed lecture schedule system vision is a mechatronic and control system simulation package that includes the ability to abstract and simulate systems containing multiple technologies with complex interactions this reduces analysis time and increases design accuracy by allowing the designer to abstractly determine accurate dynamic system behavior and simulate a control system design a great deal of lecture time can be spent working with the students to ensure a strong understanding of the analysis techniques required for even simple dynamic systems by integrating system vision into dynamic system analysis control theory and mechatronic course work the students gain not only a more complete understanding of these basic analysis techniques and their results but also observe and interact directly with the link between these basic concepts and the more complex dynamic systems and control systems the student is likely to see upon entering into industry we present the efforts of integrating mentor graphics system vision software into introductory system analysis and control theory as well as introductory mechatronic course work at oregon state university the successes failures and recommendations for further integration techniques are

and technologies to enhance and support research these online environments are dedicated to support collaboration whether in the management of a research activity the discovery analysis and curation of data or information or in the communication and dissemination of research outputs they are applicable to numerous domains and they are particularly useful for cultural heritage purposes aim of this paper is to present a virtual research environment vre for archaeology and architecture an information system has been produced which is based on open source software modules and works on the internet it permits to avoid users to be software driven and it makes possible for different persons to register and consult data from different places the system will then improve the sharing of research and data between archaeologists working on dissimilar sites and also between these professionals and the general public for the dissemination of the knowledge about the site our vre has diverse objectives digital archiving of archaeological and architectural datasets data inquiry through different interfaces notably clickable plans and 3d models attractive visualization and communication of information the information system includes possibilities of thematic and interactive treatments the thematic treatments are done from the history and the visit of the archaeological site from diverse search engines and from views of the records the interactive treatments are carried out on plans and on 3d models that are used as interactive interfaces to access the documents and objects it allows doing an exploratory visit of the site and an inquiry of all the documents that have been gathered about it according to the interests of each visitor the tool proposed is usable for every kind of archaeological site and allows managing and visualizing very diverse types of data our first experimentations and tests have been done on sites managed by the service of the national sites and monuments of luxembourg the medieval castle of vianden and the gallo roman villa of echternach in the system data with metadata chosen by the expert are recorded in the xml format standard of the w3c and automatically integrated in a mysql database afterwards the registered information is made accessible through different interfaces particularly interactive 2d and 3d representations which permit queries at spatial and temporal levels these clickable representations are 2d images or vectors created in svg and 3d models produced in vrml and x3d for a full compliance with the w3c recommendations the 3d models are principally historical models which have been initially created from multiple data sources like texts old paper plans drawings sections etc coming from the excavation work of the archaeologists at the beginning they were in a particular modeler format they have been exported in vrml and x3d afterwards and then made interactive thanks to anchor processes it is now possible to click on these models to access all the data from which they have been produced in addition the user of the system can generate his own 3d models and composition plans thanks to multi criteria data entry forms he has the choice to select for example one or several places and one or several historical phases for which he wants to generate on the fly the 3d model to see the historical evolutions of the site approximately the same process is available to create synthesis 2d plans or photo montage allowing for instance to superimpose the architectural arrangement of the castle today with its former configurations the proposed vre offers also different possibilities to improve the visualization of archaeological and architectural data which have sometimes been gathered for a long time often without computerized means this information is then highlighted in a new way rather than being forgotten in a drawer with any means of further exploitations archaeology data management

program comprehension software developers often work on multiple simultaneous projects even when only a single project is underway everyday distractions interrupt the development effort consequently developers spend significant effort pursuing recovery of their context by context we focus on the classes and methods within the code that are relevant to a specific bug being fixed or enhancement made context is reified by a program in terms of a set of presentations windows a containing source code command executions and data files however it is not enough to save the latest context even when working on a single task programmers flip between contexts as they extend their understanding and when they decide on a change they may have to visit several contexts in order to address all possible ripple effects consequently we would like to record a history of contexts and be able to retrieve them as demanded by the current task we introduce a novel technique to obtain a context consisting of

software processes models play an important role process models represent the officially sanctioned software development processes in the organization although important they are not sufficient since the practices of software developers often differ considerably from the official process practice models describing the way software development is really done are an important source of information for validating the software process using conceptual graph theory we present a formal method for representing and comparing process and practice models in various combinations the method allows for differences between these models to be easily detected software developers such as managers or engineers can then interpret these differences to make recommendations for software process improvement

projects in recent years agile practices have become popular in the software development industry meanwhile distributed development is becoming an alternative way to develop new systems the most common mode of distributed development uses outsourcing primarily to reduce costs and ensure timely completion of projects agile methods are now being recommended for distributed development however the current agile practices break down when subjected to the realities of the outsourced development marked by geographical language temporal social and cultural barriers the typical outsourced software project is also larger than the typical agile project thus agile practices need to be modified so as to find application in today s software development environment which deems outsourcing as an important component the paper comes up with a collaboration structure that can incorporate modified agile practices for outsourced projects agile practices cultural barrier geographical barrier

it is growing all the time but complaints on software quality are getting more and more common software quality depends on many factors and sometimes also universities are blamed they do not teach the essential skills that software engineering se education provides too theoretical or old fashioned courses curriculum is a complex emerging system here are analyzed factors which influence it the main conclusion is that software is a process and its quality follows from the process quality process quality is reached by disciplined practices during the development traditionally software development is based on the predefined path of development phases which all have their purpose base practices and outcomes opposite to this there is a trend towards light process oriented software development culture agile development in this approach team work active role of the client and incremental product architecture is important software development is highly human oriented sector of industry productivity can not be increased at least not dramatically by tools and automation new approaches in software industry are based on higher level of automation and reuse of available software assets large scale software development is based on reusable platforms product families artifacts developed by component factories but finally especially in the intelligence of the professionals modifying and further developing the available artifacts in spite of the improvement in automation in large scale software development the main part of software is still developed in very traditional way from the scratch based on careful user requirements elicitation specification system design and implementation se curriculum should correspond to the industry needs only then can universities produce highly skilled professionals which can satisfy needs of software industry development of curricula is supported also by different standards frameworks and recommendations developed by different interest groups but the role of these global curricula models in the development of high quality university curricula should not be over estimated different approaches in se curriculum development are introduced the experiences of authors provide a path of tested good practices towards a new curriculum structure implemented in the organizations of the authors benevolent competence and integrity based trust in knowledge transfer a look at software reuse the potential of software reuse to reduce costs and time while increasing quality in a new project development make it an important issue in the management of information systems the question of how to increase software reuse in new application development has often been asked but mostly from a managerial perspective rather than the individual perspective this research effort attempts to address this limitation by conceptualizing software as a form of knowledge and intending to examine if trustworthiness of various knowledge transfer mechanisms influences receipt of software through those mechanisms and if so which knowledge transfer mechanisms do software developers trust most we propose and intend to test a model of software reuse in which the links between knowledge transfer mechanisms and receipt of software through those mechanisms is mediated by competence integrity and benevolence based trust hypotheses are developed to test those links and appropriate methodology is outlined to conduct the research with a better understanding of why software developers trust certain mechanisms over others it will be possible to recommend better administrative policies and procedures that work in conjunction with trust to encourage software reuse knowledge management software reuse trust energy conscious factory

different practices are recommended by different methodologies they all share some common key characteristics these characteristics call for more effective coordination within development teams in this research we investigate the coordination mechanisms used in agile software development and the factors that impact their effectiveness we differentiate coordination mechanisms as vertical coordination and horizontal coordination we argue that vertical coordination and horizontal coordination are positively associated with the success of agile projects the relationship between vertical coordination and the success of agile project is moderated by project size explicit knowledge representation can positively influence vertical coordination sharing locus of practices can increase

decision makers continue to face dilemmas on whether to persist or desist with troubled projects it is important for senior managers to support the assessment of decision dilemmas faced by project managers by drawing on two case studies that exhibit project escalation situation decision makers in both cases were interviewed and important documents reviewed the paper has identified five types of decision dilemmas and their associated characteristics justification sunk cost ambiguity opportunity cost and completion the decision dilemmas identified in this study and the recommendations for countering these dilemmas aim to help project managers improve the process of decision making during project development furthermore it is also important for organizations to be aware of the role played by decision dilemmas within the escalation phenomenon as such understanding could help organizations extricate themselves from future escalation predicaments case study decision dilemmas escalation of commitment project decision making software reuse within the earth science community scientific missions in the earth sciences frequently require cost effective highly reliable and easy to use software which can be a challenge for software developers to provide the nasa earth science community spends a significant amount of resources developing software components and other software development artifacts that may also be of value if reused in other projects requiring similar functionality in general software reuse is often defined as utilizing existing software artifacts software reuse can improve productivity and quality while decreasing the cost of software development as documented by case studies in the literature since large software systems are often the results of the integration of many smaller and sometimes reusable components ensuring reusability of such software components becomes a necessity indeed designing software components with reusability as a requirement can increase the software reuse potential within a community such as the nasa earth science community the nasa earth science data systems esds software reuse working group is chartered to oversee the development of a process that will maximize the reuse potential of existing software components while recommending strategies for maximizing the reusability potential of yet to be designed components as part of this work two surveys of the earth science community were conducted the first was performed in 2004 and distributed among government employees and contractors a follow up survey was performed in 2005 and distributed among a wider community to include members of industry and academia the surveys were designed to collect information on subjects such as the current software reuse practices of earth science software developers why they choose to reuse software and what perceived barriers prevent them from reusing software in this paper we compare the results of these surveys and discuss the findings including the difference between the components desired for reuse and those made available for reuse the results are very similar with the second larger survey confirming the basic results of the first smaller survey the results suggest that reuse of earth science software can drive down the cost and time of system development increase flexibility and responsiveness of these systems to new technologies and requirements and increase effective and accountable community participation earth science nasa seeds software reuse information system outsourcing decision case study on the automotive industry outsourcing decisions in information technology it research has yielded contradictory findings and recommendations however companies are increasingly outsourcing all or some of their information systems is activities this chapter examines the potential problems a company may face under this strategy for this purpose we conducted an empirical study in a european car manufacturing company that has followed the outsourcing alternative the case analyzed offers insights about the outsourcing decision process and the difficulties the company faced when trying to adapt the software developed to the new business requirements the problems that came out pushed the company to move back to the internalisation of the is functions the case shows a greater involvement of users on in house developed projects our findings indicate that outsourcing is a good alternative when the is activity is a technical one which does not require specific knowledge of the company 2007 idea group inc testing techniques based on uml the simple generation of test cases for a software application is an ancient dream of software developers during the history of software testing research there have been some attempts in achieving this dream by promoting tools and developing environments that can help in the automatic generation of tests from different types of descriptive information of the application nevertheless it is common that neither the necessary descriptions to implement techniques nor the proper environment are regularly used in development projects due to the format frequency of use or the toughness of the applications in those developments in this communication another way of test validation is described which is highly recommended due to its simplicity and trustfulness it is based in the uml methodology and it consists that the test cases of an application can be obtained through the application activity diagrams which can be obtained from the use case specifications in such a manner that all possible ways must be covered by the test cases activity diagrams specification test cases uml safety critical software

deadlock in multi threaded applications negotiating response ability and repeatability in requirements engineering requirements engineering re practices are critical to success during the development of business software as managers assess re practices they apply specific perspectives that determine problems identified and recommendations for improvement two perspectives have recently dominated managerial thinking within the software industry one rooted in software process improvement and the other rooted in agile software development underpinning these perspectives are two theories about what constitutes good software practice in this paper we explicate these theories in relation to re and show how they differ in basic assumptions about the nature of requirements requirements capture requirements usage change management and approach to improvement the repeat ability theory holds that good requirements practices are plan driven and follow generic best practices to arrive at an agreed upon baseline of software requirements response ability holds that good requirements practices are adaptive and involve close interaction between customers and developers to arrive at satisfactory software solutions we use case study data from a software firm telsoft to show how the theories lead to different interpretations about why current practices are problematic and how problems are resolved relating to the improvement strategy adopted at telsoft we demonstrate the superiority for managers of negotiating response ability and repeat ability concerns when improving re practices the paper concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice agile methods case study cmm requirements management software process improvement personalization beyond recommender systems an application oriented overview of personalization functions personalization is an interdisciplinary topic that has been discussed in the literature of marketing and information systems as well as in other research areas in this paper we present findings from a longitudinal research project on personalization of e commerce systems the findings were taken from interviews and software development projects with company partners action research the main contribution described in this paper is the personalization map the map provides an extensive overview on personalization functions that can be used to individualize and improve human computer interaction both in b2c and b2b e commerce environments in a first step the functions are classified according to their order of appearance in the buying process in a second step they are grouped into subcategories there is no single strategy for selecting successful personalization functions as the suitability varies depending on the industry and the goods sold most definitions of personalization are closely connected to the recommendation of items based on user preferences the personalization map shows that recommender systems are an interesting but rather small part of the universe of personalization functions business modeling in process oriented organizations for rup based software development several organizations nowadays are not particularly comfortable with their internal structuring based on a hierarchical arrangement sub divided in departments where collaborators with a limited view of the overall organization perform their activities those organizations recognize the need to move to a model where multi skilled teams run horizontal business processes that cross the organization and impact suppliers and clients to develop software systems for any organization the development process must always be appropriate and controlled additionally for organizations that want to migrate to a horizontal business processes view it is required to model the organizational platform where the organizational processes will run this necessity is also true when the organization under consideration is a software house in this chapter a proposal of a generic framework for process oriented software houses is presented the way of managing the process model and the instantiation of their processes with the rational unified process rup disciplines whenever they are available or with other kind of processes is recommended as a way to control and define the software development process to illustrate the usefulness of the proposal the chapter presents how the generic reference framework was executed in a real project called premium wage and shows in some detail the created artifacts which include several uml models during the development phases following the rup disciplines especially the artifacts produced for business modeling 2007 idea group inc agile requirements engineering

an import role in species distribution prediction they provide ways to study biodiversity distribution past and present to understand its causes and to propose scenarios and strategies for sustainable use and for preservation initiatives ecological niche modeling usually involves many algorithms environmental variables data types and formats and both pre and post analysis work that complexity forces modeling experts to know and to use many software packages and to manually solve technical issues openmodeller was conceived as a framework to provide an open standardized and integrated infrastructure for accommodating geo referencing issues environmental data and algorithms deployment allowing researchers to focus on the modeling problem and on other high level analysis this paper presents an analysis of openmodeller describing its main use cases and interactions it also suggests improvements in the current software to reduce its learning curve and to increase system usability through a set of modifications the set of changes adds the following features 1 new storage component for species geographic and environmental data 2 new data import mechanisms 3 graphical user interface improvements and 4 new documentation about installing and using the software these recommendations result from a first analysis of openmodeller as part of a major project concerned with species occurrence data environmental data dataset preparation modeling algorithms pre and post analysis component based software development high performance computing web services and multiple interfaces in order to make the framework accessible to a larger range of users biodiversity informatics ecological niche modeling information systems and database openmodeller describing a design pattern why is it not enough to identify patterns in educational design in this paper we analyse the use of patterns across a number of fields including architecture software development and educational technology design focusing on the reusability of a pattern outside its area of development we have identified several issues related to the context and the value system of a pattern the paper draws together lessons learned from different fields where patterns are already used and described we conclude with a recommendation of pattern descriptors and guidelines which improve their applicability in varying value systems 2006 voigt c swatman p m design complexity design patterns pattern format research and design values security consistency in uml designs security attacks continually threaten distributed systems disrupting both individuals and organizations economically and physically in the software lifecycle early detection and correction of security flaws in the design phase can reduce overall costs associated with maintenance current software development methodologies such as the model driven architecture rely on quality unified modeling language uml design models often these models are complex and consist of many structural and behavioral views this can lead to inconsistencies between views existing approaches remedy many of these inconsistencies but do not address security consistency across design views this paper presents an approach to detecting and resolving security faults in uml designs the approach defines the notion of security inconsistency in designs analyzes uml views for security inconsistencies and generates a set of recommended design changes that include object constraint language ocl expressions the ocl can be used as a test

have been widely recognized as a successful approach in industrial software development for improving productivity software quality and time to market in this paper we focus on the usage of a pla for a quite different purpose namely handling privacy constraints in web personalization to provide personalized services such as customized recommendations a personalized website collects users personal data which raises various privacy concerns we aim at reconciling the benefits of web personalization with privacy constraints that come from users themselves as well as from privacy legislations and regulations that apply to a given user we propose a dynamic privacyenabling personalization infrastructure and conceive it as a pla this infrastructure allows for dynamically selecting and instantiating personalization architectures that provide personalized services to each individual user and comply with the prevailing privacy constraints 2006 ieee from research to management a suite

data could be in the form of defect records and their resolutions queries or responses to the customers this data may be classified as problem data and contains information that can be used for proactive problem diagnosis and resolution however in real situation it is rarely reused as the data is populated in human communication language and lacks structured information to be effectively used by it management tools ibm log and trace analyzer for autonomic computing lta 1 7 is one tool that helps it administrators and support personnel in easy problem diagnosis through its symptom database a symptom database is a collection of xml files adhering to a schema and contains records of incident and problem indications that could arise in the operation of the software or hardware infrastructure for every symptom the symptom database also contains the cause of the problem and a recommended solution for the problem typically the symptom database is created by the development teams from the scratch however we have found that the unstructured data collected by the support and the test teams can also be processed using various natural language processing and unstructured information processing algorithms to build symptom databases in this paper we present a tool the symptom database builder sdb which facilitates the conversion of problem data to a symptom database to

estimation in agile development projects one of the key measures of the resilience of a project is its ability to reach completion on time and on budget regardless of the turbulent and uncertain environment it may operate within cost estimation and tracking are therefore paramount when developing a system cost estimation has long been a difficult task in systems development and although much research has focused on traditional methods little is known about estimation in the agile method arena this is ironic given that the reduction of cost and development time is the driving force behind the emergence of the agile method paradigm this study investigates the applicability of current estimation techniques to more agile development approaches by focusing on four case studies of agile method use across different organisations the study revealed that estimation inaccuracy was a less frequent occurrence for these companies the frequency with which estimates are required on agile projects typically at the beginning of each iteration meant that the companies found estimation easier than when traditional approaches were used the main estimation techniques used were expert knowledge and analogy to past projects a number of recommendations can be drawn from the research estimation models are not a necessary component of the process fixed price budgets can prove beneficial for both developers and customers and experience and past project data should be documented and used to aid the estimation of subsequent projects agile methods cost estimation project management software development systems development an international crop nutrient management decision support system for personal digital assistant devices numass pda one of the major challenges to food security in the developing world is how to provide an adequate but not excessive application of nutrients to crops to ensure food production while maintaining or improving environmental health this has long been a problem in agriculture and is well known to be a knowledge intensive process the problem solution draws on multi disciplinary information in several disciplines of agriculture and thus provides a challenge for information technology a handheld decision aid program nutrient management support system for a personal digital assistants numass pda has been developed to support nutrient management for pda devices for extension officers farmer leaders and farmers in the tropics the program inputs begin with diagnostic field and plant data the various observations and measured

services onboard spacecraft today many different communication buses are used on spacecraft requiring software with the same basic functionality to be rewritten for each type of bus this impacts on the application software resulting in custom software for almost every new mission the spacecraft onboard interface services sois working group aims to provide a consistent interface to various onboard buses and sub networks enabling a common interface to the application software the eventual goal is reusable software that can be easily ported to new missions and run on a range of onboard buses without substantial modification the system engineer will then be able to select a bus based on its performance power etc and be confident that a particular choice of bus will not place excessive demands on software development this paper describes the sois intra networking service which is designed to enable data transfer and multiplexing of a variety of internetworking protocols with a range of quality of service support over underlying heterogeneous data links the intra network service interface provides users with a common quality of service interface when transporting data across a variety of underlying data links supported quality of service qos elements include priority resource reservation and retry redundancy these three qos elements combine and map into four tcons services for onboard data communications best effort assured reserved and guaranteed data to be transported is passed to the intra network service with a requested qos the requested qos includes the type of service priority and where appropriate a channel identifier the data is de multiplexed prioritized and the required resources for transport are allocated the data is then passed to the appropriate data link for transfer across the bus the sois supported data links may inherently provide the quality of service support requested by the intra network layer in the case where the data link does not have the required level of support the missing functionality is added by sois as a result of this architecture re usable software applications can be designed and used across missions thereby promoting common mission operations in addition the protocol multiplexing function enables the blending of multiple onboard networks this paper starts by giving an overview of the sois architecture in section ii illustrating where the tcons services fit into the overall architecture it then describes the quality of service approach adopted in section iii the prototyping efforts that have been going on are introduced in section iv finally in section v the current status of the ccsds recommendations is summarized a conformance testing approach for component based systems this paper presents an approach for conformance testing of component based systems based on black box testing appropriate testing architectures will be given such testing architectures have been standardized and recommended by iso open system interconnection for conformance testing of open systems especially communication protocols and communicating systems it consists of testing an implementation against its specification based only on the observational behavior of the implementation we investigate the reuse of conformance testing and thus the appropriate testing architectures because we believe that this test type can be an appropriate way to improve also correctness of cbs implementations and generally to support component based software engineering process component based systems conformance testing

patterns of change management and to suggest effective practices was investigated three commonly faced patterns of changes incorporated in product lines and change management practices that mitigate their adverse effects are independencies among changes in variants increasing the degree of evolving variance and reinvented variations indepencies among change incorporated in different variants pose a problem in product line evolution increasing variance results in numerous constraints across variation points and it is often difficult to leverage existing implementations of variants some recommendations for change management include modularizing of change and variation points tracking the scope and life of the variations and facilitating reuse based on knowledge sharing modeling

applications in the future against errors we have identified and solutions we recommend thus creating a quality checklist for other j2ee developers 2006 international federation for information processing visual analysis of historic hotel visitation patterns understanding the space and time characteristics of human interaction in complex social networks is a critical component of visual tools for intelligence analysis consumer behavior analysis and human geography visual identification and comparison of patterns of recurring events is an essential feature of such tools in this paper we describe a tool for exploring hotel visitation patterns in and around rebersburg pennsylvania from 1898 1900 the tool uses a wrapping spreadsheet technique called reruns to display cyclic patterns of geographic events in multiple overlapping natural and artificial calendars implemented as an improvise visualization the tool is in active development through a iterative process of data collection hypothesis design discovery and evaluation in close collaboration with historical geographers several discoveries have inspired ongoing data collection and plans to expand exploration to include historic weather records and railroad schedules distributed online evaluations of usability and usefulness have resulted in numerous feature and design recommendations 2006 ieee coordinated multiple views exploratory visualization geovisualization historical geography travel pattern analysis an approach based on modeling dynamic behavior of the system to assess the impact of cots upgrades traditional approaches of executing complete system test suite to validate software systems on deploying the upgrades of commercial off the shelf cots software components is typically costly and time consuming resulting in delay in deploying the upgrades in this paper we present a process that examines the test case dependencies at finer granularity level of altered functions in the upgrades of cots software and recommends a smaller regression test suite the process captures and analyzes the functional level runtime interactions among the applications and cots components to find the impact of the upgrades on the system the process includes a procedure to identify the altered functions in a component we have developed a prototype based on the concepts proposed in the paper and performed a case study on a web based application to illustrate efficacy of the prototype the results of the case study show that up to 80 reduction in regression test efforts could be achieved 2006 ieee automating bug report assignment open source development projects typically support an open bug repository to which both developers and users can report bugs a report that appears in this repository must be triaged to determine if the report is one which requires attention and if it is which developer will be assigned the responsibility of resolving the report large open source developments are burdened by the rate at which new bug reports appear in the bug repository the thesis of this work is that the task of triage can be eased by using a semi automated approach to assign bug reports to developers the approach consists of constructing a recommender for bug assignments examined are both a range of algorithms that can be used and the various kinds of information provided to the algorithms the proposed work seeks to determine through human experimentation a sufficient level of precision for the recommendations and to analytically determine the trade offs of the various algorithmic and information choices bug report assignment triage prototyping virtual cancer therapist vct a software engineering approach this paper proposes the virtual cancer therapist vct a scalable and robust cancer expert system that makes cancer diagnosis recommends therapy plans and simulates therapy plans in silico this system consists of an evaluation core that makes prognosis and chemotherapy simulations a biomedical database that supports therapy planning and an optimizer module that makes cancer diagnosis and produces queries for the optimal therapy plans with the support of its patient record database and simulation core vct can also be used to establish an in silico drug discovery standard that dramatically reduces the drug discovery timeline and cost the prototype of vct presented in this paper has not only demonstrated the capability of vct but also identified problems that need to be addressed in the next cycle of development 2006 ieee a webgis based command control system for forest fire fighting forest is a finite resource and fire prevention is crucial work however once a forest fire or accident occurs timely and effective fire fighting is the only necessary measure the aim of this research is to build a computerized command control system based on webgis to direct fire fighting firstly this paper introduces the total technique flow and functional modules of the system secondly this paper analyses the key techniques for building the system and they are data obtaining data organizing management architecture of webgis and sharing interoperation technique in the end this paper demonstrates the on line martial symbol editing function to show the running result of system the practical application of this system showed that it played very important role in the forest fire fighting work in addition this paper proposes some strategic recommendations for the further development of the system command control system forest fire fighting martial symbol editing webgis uml based modeling and simulation method for mission critical real time embedded system development mission critical embedded system needs to satisfy quite stringent requirements and the cost of building and testing is high dod has recommended to apply m s method to evaluate the requirements of the proposed system during the development however it is difficult to develop a simulation model because it needs both domain knowledge and simulation technique extensively which also requires intensive communication among stakeholders we therefore need an efficient method for requirements specification and simulation model development we propose uml based m s method which uses uml2 0 as the requirements specification method as well as the simulation model development tool we define constraints on uml diagrams to use them as a simulation modeling tool we specify the structure and environment of the system with class diagram and the behavioral requirements with sequence diagram the uml diagrams are then transformed to a simulation model by model transformation rules the contribution of this approach is that it provides an efficient and error preventive way of developing simulation model for mission critical embedded system development we applied this approach to develop the fire control system fcs of the navy s warship which reduced the communication overhead and simulation model development errors mission critical embedded system development model transformation uml based modeling and simulation object oriented metrics in practice using software metrics to characterize evaluate and improve the design of object oriented systems metrics are paramount in every engineering discipline software engineering however is not considered a classical engineering activity for several reasons in general if a software system is seen to deliver the required functionality only few people if any care about the internals moreover defining understanding and applying software metrics often looks like an overly complex activity recommended only to trained professionals lanza and marinescu demystify the design metrics used to assess the size quality and complexity of object oriented software systems based on statistical information from many industrial projects and generally accepted semantics they deduce many single and combined threshold values they show in detail how to identify collaboration and classification disharmony patterns in code how to visualize their results using the freely available codecrawler visualization tool and how to devise possible remedies the combination of theoretically sound results and practically tested procedures and solution paths makes this book an ideal companion for professional software architects developers and quality engineers the pattern oriented description of disharmonies offers easy access to detecting shortcomings and applying solution strategies this well written book is an important piece of work that takes the seemingly forgotten art of object oriented metrics to the next level in terms of relevance and usefulness richard c gronback chief scientist borland software corporation springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2006 all rights are reserved a rule based expert system for the diagnosis of convergence problems in circuit simulation industry standard circuit simulators use mathematical techniques that do not always guarantee a successful simulation outcome resulting in a significant loss of productivity as the circuit designer attempts to diagnose the source of the failure this paper addresses the problem of improving the diagnosis of circuit simulation non convergence through computer automation of the diagnostic process soar simulation output analysis and recommendations is the software application that implements the proposed solution to the problem circuit simulation convergence failure analysis heuristics can be encapsulated into a rule based expert system environment that emulates the reasoning of experienced circuit designers soar integrates expert system technology with a modern web based framework utilizing a database to store and retrieve simulation information gives soar the ability to diagnose simulations ranging in size from gate level circuits to full chip architectures with virtually no increase in processing time circuit convergence dc operating point bias point analysis diagnostic systems expert system simulation taxonomy of java web application frameworks this paper describes various web application frameworks and related emerging technologies pertinent to the java ee model from a technical perspective a definition of web application framework is specified as this terminology has been widely used and implies drastically different meanings in different contexts the value proposition of a web application framework is presented to illustrate how a framework can improve the application development productivity and quality the design philosophy of web application frameworks is articulated a comprehensive taxonomic scheme is defined to classify various software frameworks and web application frameworks into appropriate categories among dozens of web application frameworks available as commercial and open source solutions the predominant products are investigated followed by the selection guidelines and recommendations a reference card is constructed to summarize the key aspects of web application frameworks relevant technologies and future trends are also discussed 2006 ieee architecture of systems with the uml2 0 standard and the wright adl the domain of the software architecture emerges as an explicit field of the software engineering this is confirmed by the utilization of architecture description languages adl as wright or acme in the academic world on the other hand in spite of the new constructions offered by uml2 0 bound to the software architecture description the uml world underestimates the importance of the software architecture stage for obtaining software quality to face this situation we recommend an adaptation of uml2 0 to the adls it is in this setting that we defined a profile uml2 0 for the wright adl our profile includes a set of stereotypes applied to the descended metaclasses of the metamodel uml2 0 these stereotypes are endowed with formal constraints in ocl these extensions allow us to improve the verification of the consistency of the architectures of reusable systems ocl profile and metamodel software architecture uml2 0 wright neural disparity computation from ikonos stereo imagery in the presence of occlusions in computer vision stereoscopic image analysis is a well known technique capable of extracting the third vertical dimension starting from this knowledge the remote sensing rs community has spent increasing efforts on the exploitation of ikonos one meter resolution stereo imagery for high accuracy 3d surface modelling and elevation data extraction in previous works our team investigated the potential of neural adaptive learning to solve the correspondence problem in the presence of occlusions in this paper we present an experimental evaluation of an improved version of the neural based stereo matching method when applied to ikonos one meter resolution stereo images affected by occlusion problems disparity maps generated with the proposed approach are compared with those obtained by an alternative stereo matching algorithm implemented in a non commercial image processing software toolbox to compare competing disparity maps quality metrics recommended by the evaluation methodology proposed by scharstein and szelinski 2002 ijcv 47 7 42 are adopted dem

control system integrators are presented leary believes that the control system integrator s function is to meet the clients performance expectations by integrating the hardware software equipment into a successful system csia is committed to the business development of control system integration companies and their implementation of best practices in order to provide a healthy low risk channel for the application of technology to the industrial clients leary recommended that control system integrators should meet client performance expectations by successfully integrating hardware software equipment and should pass an intensive audit performed by an independent third party consulting firm the integrators should meet performance standards in seven business categories to become csia certified members to ensure projects are developed engineered and well managed integrating development and support tools for phm in saab 39 gripen as the requirements of a modern air vehicle changes during development and use requirements and design of test and recording functions will always have to be up to date to achieve control over recording fault isolation and health management in a tightly integrated avionics system with several configuration variants and frequent updates powerful tools are needed especially given demands for cost reduction and the limited staff available traditionally development has been divided among several departments with own processes and tools leading to redundant work and inconsistency despite tremendous inspection efforts this paper describes how the workflows to define pilot warnings recording needs and fault isolation are integrated in order to reduce development time and reuse data there are over 500 failure modes and about 100 maintenance fault reports defined for the gripen aircraft the impact of a failure is dependent on equipment configuration and thus the required pilot actions or corrective maintenance actions will differ between the variants in complex failure situations it is important to find the primary fault and filter faults that can be considered as consequences of the primary fault experience has shown that the recommended corrective actions often need to be revised as operational experience is accumulated as changes in a delivered product are costly the method of separately loadable databases for flight manuals and fault isolation information will significantly reduce the cost of an update and also enable an incremental development this paper will also describe how field loadable databases can be used in aircraft and ground support systems 2006 ieee ensuring compliance between policies requirements and software design a case study specifying correct and complete access control policies is essential to secure data and ensure privacy in information systems traditionally policy specification has not been an explicit part of the software development process this isolation of policy specification from software development often results in policies that are not in compliance with system requirements and or organizational security and privacy policies leaving the system vulnerable to data breaches this paper presents the results and lessons learned from a case study that employs the requirements based access control analysis and policy specification recaps method to specify access control policies for a web based event registration system the recaps method aids software and security engineers in specifying access control policies derived from requirements specifications and other available sources our case study revealed that the recaps method helps identify inconsistencies across various software artifacts such as requirements specification database design and organizational security and privacy policies had these problems not been identified and resolved they would have crippled later phases of software development resulted in missing or incomplete system functionality and compromised the system s security and privacy this case study reinforces validates and extends our previous recommendations that access control policy specification should be an integral part of the software development process for information systems to achieve information assurance and improve the quality of the information system 2006 ieee access control policy specification requirements analysis software design ice a system for identification of conflicts in exams although e learning has advanced considerably in the last decade some of its aspects such as e testing are still in the development phase authoring tools and test banks for e tests are becoming an integral and indispensable part of e learning platforms and with the implementation of e learning standards such as ims qti e testing material can be easily shared and reused across various platforms with the knowledge available for re use and exam automation comes a new challenge making sure that created exams are free of conflicts a conflict exists in an exam if at least two questions within that exam are redundant in content and or if at least one question reveals the answer to another question within the same exam in this paper we propose using information retrieval techniques to detect conflicts within an exam our solution ice identification of conflicts in exams is based on the vector space model relying on tfidf weighing and the cosine function to calculate similarity ice also combines the hybrid recommendation techniques of the eqrs exam question recommender system in order to propose replacements for conflicting questions 2006 ieee reliable software aids productivity the automotive companies face challenges in their efforts to cut time and cost with the increasing number of software features the automotive industry has evolved as mechanical design with embedded software development as a critical activity in the industry the motor industry reliability association misra has developed a series of guidelines for programming in the c language the misra c language aims at identifying aspects of the c language that need to be avoided due to their ambiguity and susceptibility to common programming errors the c development language has a problem that allows errors to be easily implemented the misra guidelines recommends a structured approach to be developed that seeks to clear bugs in the development cycle the use of semantic analysis tools is the most productive approach to eliminate run time errors the limitations of estimation there are inherent limitations due to the inherent uncertainties in the ability to estimate software project accurately there are a number of documented software estimation methodologies tools and models exist the tools and methodologies are primarily based on data from past projects researchers and engineers studied project data and determined equations and formulas that best matched the existing data points the effective way of using the methodology is to use more than one methodology and the standard recommendation is to use at least three methods estimates are probabilistic and to estimate more accurately it is necessary to understand accept and manage estimation s inherent uncertainties and change the estimation terminology to include the uncertainties the estimation accuracy differs at different phases in the software life cycle improving the estimation skills processes and communication with estimations will help to avoid the difficulties inherent in estimation characteristics and analysis of complex scripts this paper presents two major problems encountered in dealing with arabic and multilingual scrripts the encoding and the sorting of thses scripts the representation of arabic script by the current character encoding systems including the unicode standard is no different than any other alphabetic script these systems are conceived for encoding raw text not as glyph lists i e ignoring the script graphical structure on the other hand comparing strings can be an intricate operation that involves subtle issues and determining the sorting order cannot be done by a simple table look up or a comparison of character code values furthermore sorting rules vary not just among script systems but also among the individual languages therefore the arabic and multilingual scripts especially in the development of sorting software should receive proper considerations for the performance evaluation purpose five well known and highly recommended sorting algorithms are tested on large texts files arabic script multilingual software sorting algorithms enterprise search behaviour of software engineers technical professionals spend ∼25 of their time at work searching

better serve the needs of this group enterprise search queries search behaviour software engineers reconciling the irreconcilable a software development approach that combines agile with formal unstable software requirements are common and call for agile practices on the other hand quality standards and recommendations to which companies must adhere to play in selected markets enforce formality in the development process we present an approach tailored for a real company which reconciles these extremes we used as inputs the original software development process and its formality constraints the difficulties felt by the company and various agile approaches the outcome has been tested in various cases with encouraging results regarding awareness over project progress requirements management control of allocated effort and time and product quality although the approach was customized for a specific company it may be insightful to others facing similar challenges

approach world scientific publishing company during the testing of context sensitive middleware based software the middleware checks the current situation to invoke the appropriate functions of the applications since the middleware remains active and the situation may continue to evolve however the conclusion of some test cases may not easily be identified moreover failures appearing in one situation may be superseded by subsequent correct outcomes and therefore be hidden we alleviate the above problems by making use of a special kind of situation which we call checkpoints such that the middleware will not activate the functions under test we recommend testers to generate test cases that start at a checkpoint and end at another testers may identify relations that associate different execution sequences of a test case they then check the results of each test case to detect any contravention of such relations we illustrate our technique with an example that shows how hidden failures can be detected we also report the experimentation carried out on an rfid based location sensing application on top of a context sensitive middleware world scientific publishing company

identifier more accurately their interests analyzing other data sources that they are present possible reducing the cold start problem in this context we present a semantic approach to help integrate data from multiple sources for the construction and maintenance of user profiles that will be used to improve the quality of a recommender system to integrate data from multiple sources we defined a heuristic that quantifies the importance of each data source for a given user to validate our approach we perform a case study where the solution was coupled into a recommender system of papers focused in software engineering domain the user profiles were built extracting their information from the brazilian curriculum vitae database named cv lattes an academic platform and linkedin a

use case an empirical study of bugs in machine learning systems many machine learning systems that include various data mining information retrieval and natural language processing code and libraries are used in real world applications search engines internet advertising systems product recommendation systems are sample users of these algorithm intensive code and libraries machine learning code and toolkits have also been used in many recent studies on software mining and analytics that aim to automate various software engineering tasks with the increasing number of important applications of machine learning systems the reliability of such systems is also becoming increasingly important a necessary step for ensuring reliability of such systems is to understand the features and characteristics of bugs occurred in the systems a number of studies have investigated bugs and fixes in various software systems but none focuses on machine learning systems machine learning systems are unique due to their algorithm intensive nature and applications to potentially large scale data and thus deserve a special consideration in this study we fill the research gap by performing an empirical study on the bugs in machine learning systems we analyze three systems apache mahout lucene and opennlp which are data mining information retrieval and natural language processing tools respectively we look into their bug databases and code repositories analyze a sample set of bugs and corresponding fixes and label the bugs into various categories our study finds that 22 6 of the bugs belong to the algorithm method category 15 6 of the bugs belong to the non functional category and 13 of the bugs belong to the assignment initialization category we also report the relationship between bug categories and bug severities the time and effort needed to fix the bugs and bug impacts we highlight several bug categories that deserve attention in future research 2012 ieee hypermodelling live olap for code clone recommendation code bases contain often millions lines of code code recommendation systems ease programming by proposing developers mined and extracted use cases of a code base currently recommender systems are based on hardcoded sets what makes it complicate to adapt them another research area is adaptable live detection of code clones we advance clone detection and code recommender systems by presenting utilization of our hypermodelling approach to realize an alternative technique this approach uses data warehousing technology that scales for big data and allows for flexible and adaptable queries of source code we present the generic idea to advance recommendation and clone detection based on queries and to evaluate our application with industry source code consequently recommender systems and clone detection can be customized with flexible queries via hypermodelling this enables further research about more complex clone detection and context sensitive code recommendation data warehousing hypermodelling software engineering time independent query recommendations from search engine query logs search engine retrieves significant and essential information from the web based on the query term given by the user the query log file contains log entry for every request given by the user to the search engine and it is maintained in the system desktop or in the proxy server the process of mining the query log file improves the performance of the search engine the proposed algorithm mines the query log file to discover the similarity between the query keywords and urls in its first phase in the second phase the query cluster and the url cluster is created by using the combined similarity measure generated from the first phase the clusters recommend query to the user to frame their future queries based on their previous search histories and click through data this combined similarity based approach also recommends the

effective formal representation of knowledge used commonly in artificial intelligence semantic web software engineering and information retrieval in open and distance learning ontologies are used as knowledge bases for e learning supplements educational recommenders and question answering systems that support students with much needed resources in such systems ontology construction is one of the most important phases since there are abundant documents on the internet useful learning materials can be acquired openly with the use of an ontology however due to the lack of system support for ontology construction it is difficult to construct self instructional materials for vietnamese people in general the cost of manual acquisition of ontologies from domain documents and expert knowledge is too high therefore we present a support system for vietnamese ontology construction using pattern based mechanisms to discover vietnamese concepts and conceptual relations from vietnamese text documents in this system we use the combination of statistics based data mining and vietnamese natural language processing methods to develop concept and conceptual relation extraction algorithms to discover knowledge from vietnamese text documents from the experiments we show that our approach provides a feasible solution to build vietnamese ontologies used for supporting systems in education

support the physician oriented medical activity scheme one recommended yet rarely studied alternative expected to improve healthcare is the patient centered record we propose a development framework for such record which includes domain specific database models at the conceptual level analyzing the fundamental role of complementary information destined to ensure proper patient understanding of related clinical situations a patient centered awareness field study of user requirements and medical workflow was carried out in three medical services and two technical units to identify the most relevant elements of the framework and compared to the definitions of a theoretical approach three core data models centered on the patient medical personnel and complementary patient information corresponding to the determined set of entities information exchanges and actors roles constitute the technical recommendations of the development framework an open source proof of concept prototype

user experience in adaptive technology enhanced learning adaptive technology enhanced learning tel has attracted significant interest with the promise of supporting individual learning tailored to the unique circumstances preferences and prior knowledge of a learner however the evaluation of the overall performance of such systems is a major challenge as the adaptive tel system reacts differently for each individual user and context of use evaluation of such systems is significant but very complex area of research in itself since depending on the aspect of personalisation that needs to be

indispensable basis for both individual and industrial software engineering various kinds of labeling mechanisms like categories and tags are used in open source communities to annotate projects and facilitate the discovery of certain software however as large amounts of software are attached with no few labels or the existing labels are from different ontology space it is still hard to retrieve potentially topic relevant software this paper highlights the valuable semantic information of project descriptions and labels proposes labeled software topic detection lstd a hybrid approach combining topic models and ranking mechanisms to detect and enrich the topics of software by mining the large amount of textual software profiles which can be employed to do software categorization and tag recommendation lstd makes use of labeled lda to capture the semantic correlations between labels and descriptions and then construct the label based topic word matrix based on the generated matrix and the generality of labels lstd designs a simple yet eficient algorithm to detect the latent topics of software that expressed as relevant and popular labels comprehensive evaluations are conducted on the large scale datasets of representative open source communities and the results validate the effectiveness of lstd labeled lda open source software software profile topic detection

a conceptual modeling based software development process usability plays an important role to satisfy users needs there are many recommendations in the hci literature on how to improve software usability our research focuses on such recommendations that affect the system architecture rather than just the interface however improving software usability in aspects that affect architecture increases the analyst s workload and development complexity this paper proposes a solution based on model driven development we propose representing functional usability mechanisms abstractly by means of conceptual primitives the analyst will use these primitives to incorporate functional usability features at the early stages of the development process following the model driven development paradigm these features are then automatically transformed into subsequent steps of development a practice that is hidden from the analyst 2012 springer verlag conceptual model model driven

to annotate objects in web 2 0 applications tags can support web service understanding categorizing and discovering which are important tasks in a service oriented software system in this paper we propose a novel approach called dt both description and tags are utilized for api service clustering in this approach furthermore we present two tag recommendation strategies to improve the performance of dt to validate the effectiveness of our approach a series of experiments are carried out based on api services the experimental results show that adding relevant tags to api services which have few tags can improve the performance of dt approach api clustering recommendation tag putting dementia into context a selective literature review of assistive applications for users with dementia and their caregivers people with dementia face a decline of their cognitive functions including memory impairment and difficulty to orient in time and space assistive applications can ease the effects of dementia by assuming and supporting impaired functions context awareness is an accepted paradigm for assistive applications it enables interactive systems to react appropriately to situations that occur during daily routines of people with dementia however there currently is no recommended framework to view symptoms of dementia in terms of context and context awareness the aim of this paper is to inform designers in the early design stages of assistive applications how requirements and needs of people with dementia can be represented in a context aware application based on a systematic literature review we elicit which context types are linked to the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers and how they are used in existing assistive applications in dementia care our focus is on applications evaluated and assessed with people with dementia we also classify these assistive applications by the offered context aware services we observe that these should not be limited within the realm of the local residence context types that are valuable in house can to a certain extent also be leveraged outside a local residence we believe the proposed framework is a tool for application builders and interface designers to accomplish an informed design of systems for people with dementia 2012 springer verlag assistive applications context awareness dementia

many practitioners express their worries about current software engineering practices new recommendations should be considered to ground software engineering on solid theory and on proven principles we took such an approach towards software engineering process modeling for embedded system applications with security and dependability requirements focusing on the problem of integrating safety during the process design to clarify assessment of this kind of applications in this paper we propose a safety oriented process metamodel to support all the requirements of safety processes the resulting modeling framework serves primarily to capture the basic concepts of concerns related to safety development of embedded systems based on the clear separation between the development process the system and their properties subsequently the safety property model of the process is defined the feasibility of the approach is evaluated with a case study from the railway domain 2012 springer

empirical studies have spanned the spectrum of research from software productivity quality reliability performance to human computer interaction analyses have involved software systems ranging from desktop software to telecommunication switching systems but surprising there has been little work done on the emerging digital game industry one of the fastest growing domains today to the best of our knowledge our work is one of the first empirical analysis of a large commercially successful game system in this paper we introduce an analysis of the significant user data generated in the gaming industry by using a successful game project gotham racing 4 more specifically due to the increasing ubiquity of constantly connected high speed internet connections for game consoles developers are able to collect extensive amounts of data about their games following release the challenge now is to make sense of that data and from it be able to make recommendations to developers this paper presents an empirical case study analyzing the data collected from a released game over a three year period the results of this analysis include a better understanding of the differences between long term and shortterm players and the extent to which various options in the game are utilized this led to recommendations for future development ways to reduce development costs and to keep new players

literature studies database searches vs backward snowballing systematic studies of the literature can be done in different ways in particular different guidelines propose different first steps in their recommendations e g start with search strings in different databases or start with the reference lists of a starting set of papers in software engineering the main recommended first step is using search strings in a number of databases while in information systems snowballing has been recommended as the first step this paper compares the two different search approaches for conducting literature review studies the comparison is conducted by searching for articles addressing agile practices in global software engineering the focus of the paper is on evaluating the two different search approaches despite the differences in the included papers the conclusions and the patterns found in both studies are quite similar the strengths and weaknesses of each first step are discussed separately and in comparison with each other it is concluded that none of the first steps is outperforming the other and the choice of guideline to follow and hence the first step may be context

to assign tests in a test team background software testing can be an arduous and expensive activity a typical activity to maximise testing productivity is to allocate test cases according to the testers profile however optimising the allocation of manual test cases is not a trivial task in big companies test managers are responsible for allocating hundreds of test cases among several testers objective in this paper we propose and evaluate 2 assignment algorithms for test case allocation and 3 tester profiles based on recommender systems each assignment algorithm can be combined with 3 tester profiles which results in six possible allocation systems method we run a controlled experiment that uses 100 test suites each one with at least 50 test cases from a real industrial setting in order to compare our allocation systems to the manager s allocation in terms of precision recall and unassignment percentage of test cases the algorithm could not allocate results in our experiment the statistical analysis shows that one of the systems outperforms the others with respect to the precision and recall metrics for unassignment three of our six allocation systems achieved zero best value for the unassignment rate conclusion the results of our experiment suggest that in similar environments test managers can use our allocation systems to reduce the amount of time spent in the test case allocation task in the real industrial setting in which our work was developed managers spend from 16 to 30 working days a year on test case allocation our algorithms can help them do it

widely used as an effective way to help people cope with information overload it computes the item item similarities differentials and then selects the most similar items for prediction a weakness of current typical itembased cf approaches is that all users have the same weight in computing the item relationships in order to improve the recommendation quality we incorporate users weights based on a relationship model of users into item similarities and differentials computing in this paper a model of user relationship a method for computing users weights and weight based item item similarities differentials computing approaches are proposed for item based cf recommendations finally we experimentally evaluate our approach for recommendation and compare it to typical item based cf approaches

with a source code structure that may contain hundreds of source code elements these elements are commonly related to each other and working on a specific element may require the developer to access other related elements we propose a recommendation ap proach that uses the context of the developer to retrieve and rank recommendations of relevant source code elements in the ide these recommendations provide a shortcut to reach the desired elements and increase the awareness of the developer in relation to elements that may be of interest in that moment we have tested our approach

collaborative retrieval retrieval tasks typically require a ranking of items given a query collaborative filtering tasks on the other hand learn to model user s preferences over items in this paper we study the joint problem of recommending items to a user with respect to a given query which is a surprisingly common task this setup differs from the standard collaborative filtering one in that we are given a query x user x item tensor for training instead of the more traditional user x item matrix compared to document retrieval we do have a query but we may or may not have content features we will consider both cases and we can also take account of the user s profile we introduce a factorized model for this new task that optimizes the top ranked items returned for the given query and user

abstraction are distinguished and characterised the use of vertical abstraction in top down and bottom up program development is discussed and also the use of horizontal abstraction in one very different approach to program design the ubiquitous use of analogical models in software is explained in terms of analytical abstractions some aspects of the practical use of abstraction in the development of computer based systems are explored the necessity of multiple abstractions is argued from the essential nature of abstraction which by definition focuses on some concerns at the expense of discarding others finally some general recommendations are offered for a consciously thoughtful use of abstraction in software development 2012 springer verlag abstraction analogic model bottom up

collaborative filtering recommender systems contribute to alleviating the problem of information overload that exists on the internet as a result of the mass use of web 2 0 applications the use of an adequate similarity measure becomes a determining factor in the quality of the prediction and recommendation results of the recommender system as well as in its performance in this paper we present a memory based collaborative filtering similarity measure that provides extremely high quality and balanced results these results are complemented with a low processing time high performance similar to the one required to execute traditional similarity metrics the experiments have been carried out on the movielens and netflix databases using a representative set of information retrieval quality

problem especially if there is limited evaluation data with which to distinguish among models such as when choosing the best walk action classifier from a large pool of classifiers tuned for different viewing angles lighting conditions and background clutter in this paper we suggest that this problem of selecting a good model can be recast as a recommendation problem where the goal is to recommend a good model for a particular task based on how well a limited probe set of models appears to perform through this conceptual remapping we can bring to bear all the collaborative filtering techniques developed for consumer recommender systems e g netflix amazon com we test this hypothesis on action recognition and find that even when every model has been directly rated on a training set recommendation finds better selections for the corresponding test set than the best performers on the training set 2012 ieee validating wcag versions 1 0 and 2 0 through usability testing with disabled users the web content accessibility guidelines wcag by the web accessibility initiative wai has become the de facto standard for accessibility on the web wcag version 1 0 has become significant both as a practical tool and as an academic set of principles and is presently the basis of web accessibility evaluations and guidelines in many countries wcag version 2 0 was released in 2008 this paper reports on a study that empirically validated the usefulness of using wcag as a heuristic for website accessibility through controlled usability tests of two websites with disabled users n 7 and a control group n 6 it was found that only 27 of the identified website accessibility problems could have been identified through the use of wcag 1 0 a similar analysis of conformance to wcag 2 0 showed a marginal 5 improvement concerning identified website accessibility problems compensating for the low number of test subjects with confidence tests gave results that were still low 42 for wcag 1 0 and 49 for wcag 2 0 with 95 confidence it is concluded from this that the application of wai accessibility guidelines is not sufficient to guarantee website accessibility it is recommended that future versions of the accessibility guidelines should be based on empirical data and validated empirically and that wai expand their definition of accessibility to include usability

of navigators based on the current traffic and weather conditions also personal data as well user preferences should be considered by the navigators to generate effective recommendations however not all the relevant data may be known in a precise way since they often derive from statistical information as well as knowing all the real time information is not always feasible due to the high cost of the sensing systems moreover we don t have simple mathematical models able to generate fast right recommendations as required in the rapidly evolving scenarios featuring the activities of walking and

models have been developed to assist organizations to enhance software quality and the software engineering community has proposed numerous types of these most of them based on cmm iso iec 15504 and cmmi dev the great proliferation of maturity models leads to a need for systematic approaches to build them aim to discover and analyze the existing methods and recommended practices for developing maturity models method a systematic literature review slr was conducted results 1500 papers were returned as a result of the searches from which 23 were chosen as candidates and 7 of these published between 2005 and 2010 were eventually selected as primary studies conclusions the proposal of methods for maturity models development is an emerging topic in literature most published maturity models are based on practices and success factors from projects that showed good results in an organization or industry but which lack a sound theoretical basis and methodology the proposed methods highlight as main activities to establish goals for maturity model development to design model architecture to set out capability levels and dimensions to and pilot testing however the creation of an assessment questionnaire and specific activities for maintenance are poorly supported the slr results have served to propose a method for developing maturity models that is focused on product quality characteristics development method maturity model software process improvement on using planning poker for estimating user stories while most studies in psychology and forecasting stress the possible hazards of group processes when predicting effort and schedule agile software development methods recommend the use of a group estimation technique called planning poker for estimating the size of user stories and developing release and iteration plans it is assumed that the group discussion through planning poker helps in identifying activities that individual estimators could overlook thus providing more accurate estimates and reducing the over optimism that is typical for expert judgment based methods in spite of the widespread use of agile methods there is little empirical evidence regarding the accuracy of planning poker estimates in order to fill this gap a study was conducted requiring 13 student teams to develop a web based student records information system all teams were given the same set of user stories which had to be implemented in three sprints each team estimated the stories using planning poker and the estimates provided by each team member during the first round were averaged to obtain the statistical combination for further comparison in the same way the stories were estimated by a group of experts the study revealed that students estimates were over optimistic and that planning poker additionally increased the over optimism on the other hand the experts estimates obtained through planning poker were much closer to actual effort spent and tended to be more accurate than the statistical combination of their individual estimates the results indicate that the optimism bias caused by group discussion diminishes or even disappears as the expertise of the people involved in the group estimation process increases 2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved agile software development effort estimation expert judgment planning poker scrum user story evaluating prediction systems in software project estimation context software engineering has a problem in that when we empirically evaluate competing prediction systems we obtain conflicting results objective to reduce the inconsistency amongst validation study results and provide a more formal foundation to interpret results with a particular focus on continuous prediction systems method a new framework is proposed for evaluating competing prediction systems based upon 1 an unbiased statistic standardised accuracy 2 testing the result likelihood relative to the baseline technique of random predictions that is guessing and 3 calculation of effect sizes results previously published empirical evaluations of prediction systems are re examined and the original conclusions shown to be unsafe additionally even the strongest results are shown to have no more than a medium effect size relative to random guessing conclusions biased accuracy statistics such as mmre are deprecated by contrast this new empirical validation framework leads to meaningful results such steps will assist in performing future meta analyses and in providing more robust and usable recommendations to practitioners

requirements elicitation this paper presents a systematic review of relevant published studies related to topics in requirements engineering specifically concerning stakeholder identification methods in requirements elicitation dated from 1984 to 2011 addressing four specific research questions this systematic literature review shows the following evidence gathered from these studies current status of stakeholder identification in software requirement elicitation the best practices recommended for its performance consequences of incorrect identification in requirements quality and aspects which need to be improved our findings suggest that the analyzed approaches still have serious limitations in terms of covering all aspects of stakeholder identification as an important part of requirements elicitation however through correctly identifying and understanding the stakeholders it is possible to develop high quality software 2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved requirements elicitation requirements engineering software engineering stakeholder identification systematic review making the leap to a software platform strategy issues and challenges context while there are many success stories of achieving high reuse and improved quality using software platforms there is a need to investigate the issues and challenges organizations face when transitioning to a software platform strategy objective this case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium scale organization decided to adopt software platforms the study also reveals how new trends in software engineering i e agile methods distributed development and flat management structures interplayed with the chosen platform strategy method we used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium scale company in scandinavia we conducted 16 in depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams three of which were working on three separate platforms the collected data was analyzed using grounded theory results the findings identify four classes of challenges namely business challenges organizational challenges technical challenges and people challenges the article explains how these findings can be used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool support conclusion the organization s decision to adopt a software platform strategy introduced a number of challenges these challenges need to be understood and addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse researchers need to further investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for platform development the role of agile methods in software platforms tool support for testing and continuous integration in the

on the agreement of reviewers about the quality of software engineering experiments context during systematic literature reviews it is necessary to assess the quality of empirical papers current guidelines suggest that two researchers should independently apply a quality checklist and any disagreements must be resolved however there is little empirical evidence concerning the effectiveness of these guidelines aims this paper investigates the three techniques that can be used to improve the reliability i e the consensus among reviewers of quality assessments specifically the number of reviewers the use of a set of evaluation criteria and consultation among reviewers we undertook a series of studies to investigate these factors method two studies involved four research papers and eight reviewers using a quality checklist with nine questions the first study was based on individual assessments the second study on joint assessments with a period of inter rater discussion a third more formal randomised block experiment involved 48 reviewers assessing two of the papers used previously in teams of one two and three persons to assess the impact of discussion among teams of different size using the evaluations of the teams of one person as a control results for the first two studies the inter rater reliability was poor for individual assessments but better for joint evaluations however the results of the third study contradicted the results of study 2 inter rater reliability was poor for all groups but worse for teams of two or three than for individuals conclusions when performing quality assessments for systematic literature reviews we recommend using three independent reviewers and adopting the median assessment a quality checklist seems useful but it is difficult to ensure that the checklist is both appropriate and understood by reviewers furthermore future experiments should ensure participants are given more time to understand the quality checklist and to evaluate the research papers 2012 elsevier b v all rights reserved empirical studies experimentation human intensive experiments quality evaluation software engineering an empirical study of supplementary bug fixes a recent study finds that errors of omission are harder for programmers to detect than errors of commission while several change recommendation systems already exist to prevent or reduce omission errors during software development there have been very few studies on why errors of omission occur in practice and how such errors could be prevented in order to understand the characteristics of omission errors this paper investigates a group of bugs that were fixed more than once in open source projects those bugs whose initial patches were later considered incomplete and to which programmers applied supplementary patches our study on eclipse jdt core eclipse swt and mozilla shows that a significant portion of resolved bugs 22 to 33 involves more than one fix attempt our manual inspection shows that the causes of omission errors are diverse including missed porting changes incorrect handling of conditional statements or incomplete refactorings etc while many consider that missed updates to code clones often lead to omission errors only a very small portion of supplementary patches 12 in jdt 25 in swt and 9 in mozilla have a content similar to their initial patches this implies that supplementary change locations cannot be predicted by code clone analysis alone furthermore 14 to 15 of files in supplementary patches are beyond the scope of immediate neighbors of their initial patch locations they did not overlap with the initial patch locations nor had direct structural dependencies on them e g calls accesses subtyping relations etc these results call for new types of omission error prevention approaches that complement existing change recommendation systems 2012 ieee bug fixes empirical study patches software evolution claims and supporting evidence for self adaptive systems a literature study despite the vast body of work on self adaption no systematic study has been performed on the claims associated with self adaptation and the evidence that exists for these claims as such an insight is crucial for researchers and engineers we performed a literature study of the research results from seams since 2006 and the associated dagstuhl seminar in 2008 the study shows that the primary claims of self adaptation are improved flexibility reliability and performance of the system on the other hand the tradeoffs implied by self adaptation have not received much attention evidence is obtained from basic examples or simply lacking few systematic empirical studies have been performed and no industrial evidence is reported from the study we offer the following recommendations to move the field forward to improve evaluation researchers should make their assessment methods tools and data publicly available to deal with poor discussion of limitations conferences workshops should require an explicit section on limitations in engineering papers to improve poor treatment of tradeoffs this aspect should be an explicit subject of reviews and finally to enhance industrial validation the best academy industry efforts could be formally recognized by the community 2012 ieee passive and active solar systems for

know about the effectiveness of software design patterns context although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures objectives to investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design method we conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the x201c gang of four x201d these studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed the patterns that were studied as well as the context within which the study took place results our searches identified 611 candidate papers applying our inclusion exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of x201c formal x201d experimental studies of object oriented design patterns we augmented our analysis by including seven x201c experience x201d reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms we report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist conclusions we could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design for future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns and seek to identify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance 2012 ieee design patterns empirical software engineering systematic literature review actionable

software development organizations our goal is to identify these socio technical constructs as they emerge so that we can provide timely awareness and actionable recommendations to managers technical leads and members of the emergent team alike our technique is rooted in the analysis of social networks which are constructed from real time traces of the activity of each individual developer within

software development during the software development process developers are often faced with problem solving situations for instance it is common the occurrence of exceptions that originate stack traces in the console view of the ide these situations motivate the developer to use the web to search for information however there is a gap between the ide and the web requiring developers to spend significant time searching for relevant information and navigating through web pages in a web browser we propose to process the information of exception stack traces and retrieve question answering web resources to help developers we developed a tool that integrates recommendation of question answer web resources in eclipse according to the context of these exception stack traces the results of a preliminary experimentation are promising showing that our approach performs better than a simple keyword based approach 2012 ieee context modelling problem solving recommendation systems software

versions of source code is a common and essential activity during the lifespan of large scale software systems when a non trivial number of conflicts is detected there is a need to support the maintainer in investigating and resolving these conflicts in this paper we contribute a cost benefit approach to ranking the conflicting software entities by leveraging both structural and semantic information of the source code we present a study by applying our approach to a legacy system developed by computational scientists the study not only demonstrates the feasibility of our approach but also sheds light on the future development of conflict resolution recommenders 2012 ieee conflict resolution cost benefit analysis recommendation software merging example overflow using social media

software engineering skills as well as domain and user knowledge this knowledge is difficult to master increasing complexity and fast evolving technologies cause deficits in development and system behavior they cause discrepancies between expectations and observations we propose using discrepancies as a trigger for recommendations to developers discrepancies in using a software application are combined with discrepancies between development artifacts to efficiently support software engineers recommendations must consider knowledge bases of discrepancies and resolution options they evolve over time along with evolving experience hence recommendations and organizational learning are intertwined 2012 ieee end user feedback heuristics recommendation interaction histories mining for software change guide this paper presents a prediction model for change propagation based on the developers interaction history since artifacts have internal and external dependencies a change will cause some changes on related artifacts in order to guide change operations in software development our proposed method generates a change guide graph by mining developers interaction histories which consist of write and read accesses to artifacts using a change guide graph we can guide change using the context of previous changes to evaluate proposed change guide method we perform a case study with an open source software we show that the context information is effective for file level and method level change predictions 2012 ieee recommendation system for design patterns in software

development to have a good and reusable system designers and developers must be aware of large information set and many quality concerns e g design patterns systems with correct design pattern may ensure easy maintenance and evolution however without assistance designing and development of software systems following certain design patterns is difficult for engineers recommendation systems for software engineering can assist designers and developers with a wide range of activities including suggesting design patterns with the help of pattern recommenders designers can come up with a reusable design we provide a design pattern recommender dpr process overview for software design to suggest design patterns based on a simple goal question metric gqm approach our prototype provides two fold solution in the primary level dpr only proposes one or more design patterns for a problem context and in the secondary level for a initial set of design dpr refactors models and suggests design patterns our preliminary evaluation shows that dpr has a good trade off between accuracy and procedural complexity comparing to other state of the art approaches 2012 ieee design pattern recommendation system software reuse context aware recommender systems for non functional requirements for large software projects system designers have to adhere to a significant number of functional and non functional requirements which makes software development a complex engineering task if these requirements change during the development process complexity even increases in this paper we suggest recommendation systems based on context aware composition to enable a system designer to postpone and automate decisions regarding efficiency non functional requirements such as performance and focus on the design of the core functionality of the system instead context aware composition suggests the optimal component variants of a system for different static contexts e g software and hardware environment or even different dynamic contexts e g actual parameters and resource utilization thus an efficiency non functional requirement can be automatically optimized statically or dynamically by providing possible component variants such a recommender system reduces time and effort spent on manually developing optimal applications that adapts to different static or dynamic contexts and even changes thereof 2012 ieee context aware composition context aware recommender systems nonfunctional requirements extending recommendation systems with software maps in practice recommendation systems have evolved as helpful tools to facilitate and optimize software engineering processes serving both developers and managers specific recommendation systems address their individual problems yet in a number of cases complementing them with other techniques can enhance their use and extend their scope in this paper we first discuss different perspectives on software engineering processes and examples of recommendation systems that support representatives of these perspectives we then identify how select software map techniques can extend recommendation systems to facilitate decision making by addressing the perspectives information and communication needs 2012 ieee computer aided analysis context decision making visualization automatically detecting architecturally relevant code anomalies software architecture degradation is a longstanding problem in software engineering previous studies have shown that certain code anomalies or patterns of code anomalies are likely to be harmful to architecture design although their identification is far from trivial this study presents a system for not only detecting architecturally relevant code anomalies but also helping developers to prioritize their removal by ranking them we detect code anomaly patterns based on static analysis that also exploit architecture information 2012 ieee architectural

comparison of recommender systems for mashup composition web mashups are a new generation of applications created by composing contents and functions available through web services and apis a central activity in mashup development is the retrieval and selection of components to be included in the composition the adoption of recommender systems can alleviate some of the difficulties arising in this activity based on the results of an empirical study this paper tries to shed light on the application of recommender systems to the mashup composition domain and discusses the performance of different

user stories are short feature descriptions from the user s point of view functional tests ensure that the feature described by a user story is fully implemented we present a tool that builds an ontology for code and links completed user stories in natural language with the related code artifacts the ontology also contains links to api components that were used to implement the functional

search based code recommendation system search based code recommendation systems with a large scale code repository can provide the programmers example code snippets that teach them not only names in application programming interface of libraries and frameworks but also practical usages consisting of multiple steps however it is not easy to optimize such systems because usefulness of recommended code is indirect and hard to be measured we propose a method that mechanically evaluates usefulness for our recommendation system called selene by using the proposed method we adjusted several search and user interface parameters in selene for better recall factor and also learned characteristics of those parameters 2012 ieee associative text search example code recommendation integrated development environment recommending relevant code artifacts for change requests using multiple predictors finding code artifacts affected by a given change request is a time consuming process in large software systems various approaches have been proposed to automate this activity e g based on information retrieval the performance of a particular prediction approach often highly depends on attributes like coding style or writing style of change request thus we propose to use multiple prediction approaches in combination with machine learning first experiments show that machine learning is well suitable to weight different prediction approaches for individual software projects and hence improve prediction performance 2012 ieee recommendation systems software maintenance harnessing stack overflow for the ide developers often consult online tutorials and message boards to find solutions to their programming issues among the many online resources question answer websites are

been acknowledged by any integrated development environment ide even though developers spend a large part of their working time in ides and the usage of q a services has dramatically increased developers can only use such resources using external applications we introduce seahawk an eclipse plugin to integrate stack overflow crowd knowledge in the ide it allows developers to seamlessly access stack overflow data thus obtaining answers without switching the context we present our preliminary work on seahawk it allows users to 1 retrieve q a from stack overflow 2 link relevant

parallelization of existing programs or refactoring of source code is time consuming as well as error prone and would benefit from tool support however existing automatic transformation systems are not extensively used because they either require tedious definitions of source code transformations or they lack general adaptability in our approach a programmer changes code inside a project resulting in before and after source code versions the difference the generated transformation is stored in a database when presented with some arbitrary code our tool mines the database to determine which of the generalized transformations possibly apply our system is different from a pure compiler based semantics preserving approach as we only suggest code modifications our contribution is a set of generalizing annotations that we have found by analyzing recurring patterns in open source projects we show the usability of our system and the annotations by finding matches and applying generated

similar challenges to developers regarding the identification of useful elements in large and complex reusable modeling libraries this paper proposes an approach for recommending library elements for domain specific languages we instantiate the approach for simulink models and evaluate it by recommending library blocks for a body of 165 simulink files from a public repository we compare two alternative variants for computing recommendations association rules and collaborative filtering our results indicate that the collaborative filtering approach performs better and produces

to leverage existing libraries and frameworks however correctly and efficiently choosing and using apis from unfamiliar libraries and frameworks is still a non trivial task programmers often need to ruminate on api documentations that are often incomplete or inspect code examples that are often absent to learn api usage patterns recently various techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem by creating api summarizations mining code examples or showing common api call sequences however few techniques focus on recommending api parameters in this paper we propose an automated technique called precise to address this problem differing from common code completion systems precise mines existing code bases uses an abstract usage instance representation for each api usage example and then builds a parameter usage database upon a request precise queries the database for abstract usage instances in similar contexts and generates parameter candidates by concretizing the instances adaptively the experimental results show that our technique is more general and applicable than existing code completion systems specially 64 of the parameter recommendations are useful and

to assist less skilled developers in composing own mashups by interactively recommending composition knowledge in the form of modeling patterns and fostering knowledge reuse our prototype system demonstrates our idea of interactive recommendation and automated pattern weaving which involves recommending relevant composition patterns to the users during development and once selected applying

engineering integration a real time ergonomic monitoring system using the microsoft kinect laborers in factories all across the world perform physically intensive tasks daily with every lift they put themselves at risk of injury many still frame modeling systems exist that can assess the different stresses and strains on the laborers body given his or her position these models are only usable by experts and do not allow for real time alerts in 1995 companies in the united states lost 50 billion due to injured employee absences and compensation settlements companies are not only eager to reduce their overhead costs but also aim to better society by offering more robust worker safety practices the focus of this project was to design a system that can be used in a training environment our system is used to teach employees if their current lifting and carrying methods can be detrimental to their health our system is designed to be used for longstanding employees as well as new hires this project s primary requirement was to implement a motion sensing device to aid in the analysis of ergonomics in an industrial environment to do this we proposed to make use of microsoft kinect sensors the kinect is able to provide skeletal tracking at 30 frames second for two individuals in the field of view to develop the system we selected the microsoft software development kit sdk from a large variety of alternative professional and open source sdks because of a variety of desirable features a static ergonomic model was integrated with the kinect software multiple other software packages were assessed for compatibility with the kinect in an effort to enhance the kinects o ability to recognize objects and humans after development was complete the system was tested by analyzing our system s output using different skeletal lift positions to compare to the real results our system provides real time ergonomic analysis of lifts performed by humans this system lacks the ability to recognize specific individuals and objects necessary to customize the system to adequately evaluate a lift and has not been tested in a factory environment in the future we hope to implement a dynamic ergonomic model so that it can recognize whole movements or gestures which lead to injury rather than recognizing a single position our system successfully outputs a number for the recommended weight limit as well as other methods to measure the strain on a worker s skeleton in a training environment the system will help individuals correct the problems with their lifting motions 2012 ieee

knowledge query prioritization for index tuning leads to improvement of performance in databases we propose an analytical model which centers around managing index objects that are aligned to the queries submitted by the users through an online transaction processing oltp system we first define a strategy to prioritize queries based on certain configurable parameters and call them as short listed queries the next step is to analyze the existing index objects that were created by the dba during the initial database setup and to check if these index objects are aligned to the short listed queries eventually the system generates a recommendation report to the dba which lists new indexes to be created that are aligned to short listed queries and list of obsolete indexes that are potential candidates to be dropped due to low utilization rates this approach introduces a new facet for adoption towards performance analysis and improvements in software systems we present an

software prevention discovery elimination and mitigation software defects due to coding errors continue to plague the industry with disastrous impact especially in the enterprise application software category identifying how much of these defects are specifically due to coding errors is a challenging problem in this paper we investigate the best methods for preventing new coding defects in enterprise resource planning erp software and discovering and fixing existing coding defects a large scale survey based ex post facto study coupled with experiments involving static code analysis tools on both sample code and real life million lines of code open source erp software were conducted for such purpose the survey based methodology consisted of respondents who had experience developing erp software this research sought to determine if software defects could be merely mitigated or totally eliminated and what supporting policies procedures and infrastructure were needed to remedy the problem in this paper we introduce a hypothetical framework developed to address our research questions the hypotheses we have conjectured the research methodology we have used a nd the data analysis methods used to validate the stated hypotheses our study revealed that a the best way for erp developers to discover coding error based defects in existing programs is to choose an appropriate programming language perform a combination of manual and automated code auditing static code analysis and formal test case design execution and analysis b the most effective ways to mitigate defects in an erp system is to track the defect densities in the erp software fix the defects found perform regression testing and update the resulting defect density statistics and c the impact of epistemological and legal commitments on the defect densities of erp systems is inconclusive we feel that our proposed model has the potential to vastly improve the quality of erp and other

results the current peer review process is however fraught with many problems that undermine the pace validity and credibility of science we highlight five salient problems 1 reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise 2 reviewers do not have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study 3 reviewers are neither identified nor acknowledged 4 there is no measure of the quality of a review and 5 reviews take a lot of time and once submitted cannot evolve we propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer s specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency greater scrutiny and replication of results acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions which could be used to establish the impact of the reviewer in the scientific community quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of

of a project to develop a web based virtual teaching assistant system vitas for college students and instructors vitas a digital homework assignments submission and grading system is an innovative idea to provide homework assignments grading system for the instructors and to provide an interactive learning environment outside the lecture period for the students using vitas students will be able to submit the homework assignments online to engage in anonymous homework review and to discuss with their peers the idea of students grading the homework assignments of their peers is very beneficial because during the process of grading other s homework the students get the opportunity to learn review their own work mistakes also the instructors finalize all grades and post them on the website to confirm the students learning activities in particular this project focuses on the agile software development process which is a group of software development methodologies based on iterative interactive and incremental development where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self organizing and cross functional teams i e software development and user experience design of the vitas also the research considers that the teams are working cooperatively rather than collaboratively and this cooperation is implemented via articulation work meaning that the developers had additional tasks to ensure that the user experience design is accomplished overall the paper provides an insight into a culture where developers and user experience designers work together adds evidence to support the agile principle of self organizing teams and recommends the recognition of interaction tasks as valuable work in agile software development 2012 american society

recognized as a revolutionary paradigm for software development web services have acquired enormous popularity among software developers this popularity has motivated developers to publish a large number of web service descriptions in uddi registries according to the web service architecture wsa published by w3c users can find services through the repository universal description discovery and integration uddi however the uddi may find many web services with similar functions and users may have difficulty deciding which service is suitable this paper proposes a unified collaborative filtering model for web service recommendation to help users to select the suitable web service the method in this paper combined the latent and external features of users and services for accurate recommendation the main advantages of this technique over standard memory based methods are the higher accuracy constant time prediction and an explicit and compact model representation the experimental evaluation shows that substantial improvements in accuracy over existing methods can be obtained 2012 binary information press january 2012 collaborative filtering probabilistic latent

bootstrap and spice iso iec 15504 are based on formal frameworks and promote the use of systematic processes and management practices for software development these approaches identify best practices for the management of software development and when applied enable organizations to understand control and improve development processes the purpose of a spi assessment is to compare the current processes used in an organization with a list of recommended or best practices this research investigates the adoption of spi initiatives by four small software development firms these four firms participated in a process improvement program which was sponsored by software engineering australia sea queensland the assessment method was based on spice iso iec 15504 and included an initial assessment recommendations and a follow up meeting for each firm before and after snapshots are provided of the capability as assessed on eight processes the discussion which follows summarizes the

identification of traceability links between source code and requirements 2012 by knowledge systems institute graduate school software developers are interested in requirement traceability to e g verify if all requirements are covered by a system design specification based on the assumption that related artifacts contain related terms researchers have developed used and extended algorithms that identify related terms and subsequently infer which artifacts are related i e there is a traceability link between them source code is not as verbose as a natural language description which reduces the applicability of algorithms that precisely rely on such a commonality this paper extends the vector space model using tf idf term weights to improve the identification of traceability links between source code and requirements to this extent we modify the way how requirements are identified and to include user feedback we show that the inclusion of user feedback significantly improved the number of correctly identified requirements information retrieval recommender systems requirement traceability the correctness by construction approach to programming springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2012 the focus of this book is on bridging the gap between two extreme methods for developing software on the one hand there are texts and approaches that are so formal that they scare off all but the most dedicated theoretical computer scientists on the other there are some who believe that any measure of formality is a waste of time resulting in software that is developed by following gut feelings and intuitions kourie and watson advocate an approach known as correctness by construction a technique to derive algorithms that relies on formal theory but that requires such theory to be deployed in a very systematic and pragmatic way first they provide the key theoretical background like first order predicate logic or refinement laws that is needed to understand and apply the method they then detail a series of graded examples ranging from binary search to lattice cover graph construction and finite automata minimization in order to show how it can be applied to increasingly complex algorithmic problems the principal purpose of this book is to change the way software developers approach their task at programming in the small level with a view to improving code quality thus it coheres with both the ieee s guide to the software engineering body of knowledge swebok recommendations which identifies themes covered in this book as part of the software engineer s arsenal of tools and methods and with the goals of the software engineering method and theory semat initiative which aims to refound software engineering based on a solid theory systematic literature review of machine learning based software development effort estimation models context software development effort estimation sdee is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system in order to improve estimation accuracy many researchers have proposed machine learning ml based sdee models ml models since 1990s however there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ml models in a systematic way objective this research aims to systematically analyze ml models from four aspects type of ml technique estimation accuracy model comparison and estimation context method we performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ml model published in the last two decades 1991 2010 results we have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research after investigating these studies we found that eight types of ml techniques have been employed in sdee models overall speaking the estimation accuracy of these ml models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non ml models furthermore different ml models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts conclusion ml models are promising in the field of sdee however the application of ml models in industry is still limited so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ml models to this end based on the findings of this review we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners 2011 elsevier b v all rights

method for thinking about systems in organizations whether or not complete data and technical expertise are available wsm s goal is to help business professionals understand and communicate about a system at whatever level of detail is appropriate wsm treats systems as sociotechnical work systems with human participants rather than technical systems with users it applies a static view of systems the work system framework and a dynamic view the work system life cycle model it combines those frameworks with conventional problem solving by defining the system in relation to problems and opportunities drilling down to understand the situation in more detail and producing a justified recommendation over 600 employed mba and executive mba students have used various versions of wsm to produce management briefings including recommendations about it reliant work systems in their own organizations while wsm can stand alone to help business professionals it also can be used in

systems analysis systems thinking work system method assigning change requests to software developers the paper presents an approach to recommend a ranked list of expert developers to assist in the implementation of software change requests e g bug reports and feature requests an information retrieval ir based concept location technique is first used to locate source code entities e g files and classes relevant to a given textual description of a change request the previous commits from version control repositories of these entities are then mined for expert developers the role of the ir method in selectively reducing the mining space is different from previous approaches that textually index past change requests and or commits the approach is evaluated on change requests from three open source systems argouml eclipse and koffice across a range of accuracy criteria the results show that the overall accuracies of the correctly recommended developers are between 47 and 96 for bug reports and between 43 and 60 for feature requests moreover comparison results with two other recommendation alternatives show that the presented approach outperforms them with a substantial margin

usage patterns from software repositories using method categorization developers often have difficulties using apis to aid developers in efficiently using apis api usage patterns can be extracted from source code stored in software repositories previous approaches have mined repositories to extract api usage patterns by simply applying a data mining technique to the collection of method invocations of api objects however respective roles of invoked methods within api objects are not considered in these approaches this paper proposes an improved approach that extracts api usage patterns at a higher level abstraction rather than mining the actual method invocations our approach embraces a multilevel sequential mining technique and uses categorization of method invocations to define their concept hierarchy in the categorization the method invocations are categorized based on their roles the extracted api usage patterns represent recurring usages of api objects therefore they are useful

composing dynamic services for mobile devices in the context of mobile devices services from several devices can be composed such compassable services may include data and device resources such as microphones or cameras the services can be composed to create collaborative composite services such as video streaming the mobility of the devices makes the service compositions inherently dynamic further the set of possible service compositions may be large and thus finding a suitable service composition at runtime becomes a challenge recommender systems are intelligent information systems that propose items to a user based on the user preferences they are particularly useful in under constrained problems where the most suitable item is recommended from a large set of possible items that satisfy the user preferences the main contribution of this paper is the application of knowledge based recommendation techniques for composing dynamic services for mobile devices the contribution is exemplified and validated with the social device platform which provides interactive proximity based service compositions for mobile devices knowledge based recommender systems were found to be

the product ratings of every other user in this paper we have proposed an improved approach to compute the neighborhood by exploiting the categories of products in the proposed approach ratings given by a user are divided into different sub groups based on the categories of products we consider that the ratings of each sub group are given by a virtual user for a target user the recommendations of the corresponding virtual user are computed by employing cf next the recommendations of the corresponding virtual users of the target user are combined for recommendation the experimental results on

evaluation of software safety integrity level on embedded systems this paper proposes a nevel approach supporting evaluation of software safety integrity level sil which is a relative target level of risk reduction provided by a safety function using failure frequency software safety on embedded systems has become an important software engineering challenge since the embedded system is closely used to human life and the software directly controls most operations of the embedded system to address this challenge several techniques have been proposed to analyze and evaluate the software safety however although these analysis and evaluation techniques have been proposed still experts need to qualitatively evaluate the software sil even if the representative international standard for safety iec 61508 deals with software sil evaluation since existing standards enumerate only recommended software techniques for evaluating software sil therefore certification of software sil highly depends on a third party consulting company and this high dependency makes additional cost hence our approach can be used without the dependency before formal certification of software sil our approach identifies possible failures on embedded systems and calculates a probability of failure frequency using markov process using the probability we define quantitative measures to evaluate software sil we also conducted a case study using open data to evaluate our approach the result of case study demonstrates that our approach can be a reasonable method to support quantitative evaluation of software sil without expert s knowledge 2011 aicit understanding a developer social network and its evolution with the growing number of large scale software projects software development and

that while most social networks exhibit power law degree distributions our dsns do not in addition we also examine how dsns evolve over time highlighting how events within a project such as a release

governed by the magnitude of effectiveness factor which is evaluated based on the generalized integral for the estimation of thiele type modulus and the corresponding correlation for effectiveness factor as a hyperbolic tangent function and also based on the analytical expression proposed by gottifredi and gonzo parameters such as operating semifluidisation velocity porosity of fluidized section height ratio of packed section to fluidized section are estimated from experimental correlations that are selected through elaborate trial and error procedure though the simulation model involves simplifications and empirical estimation of a few parameters model results are found to exhibit reasonably good agreement with data collected through extensive experimental investigations the maximum deviation being ±12 5 this confirms the acceptability of the software package developed the developed software could be therefore recommended for the design and installation of industrial

whether a more effective sensitive and or productive precise search can be achieved by following the qgs based process method we used a dual case study in which each case includes two observations of se literature search for the same slr but using and not using the qgs based approach the overall sensitivity and precision were calculated for each observation that implemented different search design results the use of qgs based search process resulted in higher sensitivity and precision in this dual case study conclusions a systematic search process can help capture more relevant studies as well as save researchers time spent on literature search activities our observations also support that an integrated search strategy is recommended for slrs in se to avoid the possible limitations of

engineering ontology users frustration and hci in the software development life cycle users frustration on the software used will affect the productivity in addition the ignorance of users involvement in the system development methodology will cause problems to the users later on in the human computer interaction hci literature it has been recommended that user s involvement and hci consideration in the software development life cycle sdlc as an important mechanism for a successful system implementation however it is still unclear to what extend do the users involvement and hci consideration have been adopted by software development practitioners this paper reports on the results of a survey on the importance of hci in sdlc from the practitioners perspective the survey involves thirty two 32 software designers the objectives of the study are to identify the state of users involvement in sdlc and to identify the hci elements that have been addressed results show that many of the practitioners have involved the users in sdlc but majority only during the requirement analysis phase the findings have also revealed that hci elements on functionality are well addressed however the non functionality elements such as cultural and affective values have not been emphasized by practitioners the paper concludes with a recommendation to further investigate the users awareness on the

agile factors helping self management to self reflect in this paper a tool is proposed to foster reflection in agile software development teams based upon the qualitative model of moe et al 11 we contribute a quantitative questionnaire organized along five dimensions of agile teamwork analogous to the five factor model in contemporary psychology to test this survey tool and its alignment with existing studies we have executed an empirical validation of the tool with 79 individuals and 8 international scrum teams we find that interteam agreement on the factors is high and that the survey tool is found very useful the instrument offers a comparable measure to agile teams and gives recommendations for each of the factors helping to understand individual as well as organizational level barriers springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2011 agile teams organizational management and coordination process implementation and change scrum self management software development knowledge engineering support for agent oriented software reuse automating software engineering tasks is essential to achieve better productivity in software development and quality of software products knowledge engineering can address this challenge through the representation and reuse of knowledge of how and when to perform a development task this chapter describes a knowledge based approach for automating agent oriented development whose main components are a software process madae pro and an integrated development environment madaeide madae pro is an ontology driven process for multi agent domain and application engineering which promotes the construction and reuse of agent oriented application families madae ide is an integrated development environment which assists developers in the application of madae pro allowing full or partial automation of its modeling tasks through a set of production rules that explores the semantic representation of modeling products in its knowledge base the approach has been evaluated through the development of a multi agent system family of recommender systems supporting alternative collaborative content based and hybrid filtering techniques some examples from these case studies are presented to illustrate and detail the domain analysis and application requirements engineering tasks of madae pro 2011 igi global a topic based approach for narrowing the search space of buggy files from a bug report locating buggy code is a time consuming task in software development given a new bug report developers must search through a large number of files in a project to locate buggy code we propose bugscout an automated approach to help developers reduce such efforts by narrowing the search space of buggy files when they are assigned to address a bug report bugscout assumes that the textual contents of a bug report and that of its corresponding source code share some technical aspects of the system which can be used for locating buggy source files given a new bug report we develop a specialized topic model that represents those technical aspects as topics in the textual contents of bug reports and source files and correlates bug reports and corresponding buggy files via their shared topics our evaluation shows that bugscout can recommend buggy files correctly up to 45 of the cases with a recommended ranked list of 10 files 2011 ieee defect localization topic modeling a systematic approach for designing educational recommender systems the construction of educational recommender system ers demands the incorporation of quality attributes at the software design such as availability for preventing the service to be unavailable for a long time and scalability for preventing the system from going offline due to a large number of simultaneous requests the incorporation of such characteristics makes ers more complex and expensive but existing strategies for designing ers do not consider quality attributes in an explicit way this chapter presents an architecture centered solution which is partially supported by tools and considers quality attributes as early as possible in the software development process in a systematic way from requirements to the source code the feasibility of the proposed process is showed in terms of a case study executed in a step by step fashion presenting how the software architecture can be designed and gradually refined until it achieves the level of object oriented classes generated based on design patterns 2012 igi global high integrity agile processes for the development of safety critical software typically safety critical software systems are developed using plan driven development processes agile processes have evolved to help reduce costs of software development and seek to minimise documentation overheads for safety critical systems that must undergo certification documentation is essential the question this paper addresses is can a process based on agile principles be used to deliver a safety critical software product but also the evidence needed to satisfy assurance objectives the paper makes three contributions firstly it presents an analysis of agile processes and their applicability in this domain it reviews positive indicators for their use outlines challenges associated with their deployment and proposes strategies for addressing these challenges secondly it makes a number of recommendations for adapting an agile process to the domain finally the paper reports on an experiment to demonstrate the plausibility of using of an adapted agile process for building a safety critical software system copyright 2011 inderscience enterprises ltd agile processes aps certification safety critical systems trends in harmonization of multiple reference models diverse models currently exist in the field of software engineering which help organizations to apply recommended practices in order to support ther multiple needs in the areas of software development maintenance and operation security it government etc examples of such models are cmmi iso 9001 iso 12207 iso 27001 cobit itil nevertheless many differences exist between these models since each model defines its own structure terminology definitions and quality systems amongst other aspects this issue increases the complexity when an organization is required to apply two or more models in order to satisfy its needs organizations must therefore define the most appropriate means of choosing and implementing multi models and harmonization may be one solution this paper presents a systematic literature review with the aim of analyzing the state of the art with regard to inititatives concerning the harmonization of multiple reference models as a result it has been concluded that there is currently a lack of guidelines with which to help organizations to implement the harmonization of multiple models and of a unified terminology with which to homogenize the diversity of the structure of the different models and the harmonization techniques which can be applied in order to address these issues a framework to support the harmonization of multiple models is outlined springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2011 harmonization multi model multiple reference models software process improvement systematic review intrusive test automation with failed test case clustering regression testing is an indispensable process in software development which ensures stable features have not been adversely broken by new changes when gui plays an important role in an application a popular choice to automate the tests is applying gui capture replay tools unfortunately in many applications which render images as output the correctness of a replay run can no longer be straightforwardly verified in this paper we propose a test automation solution called intrusive test automation which uses program instrumentation technique to collect the runtime internal information of a program as a result the correctness of a test run can be verified by the runtime traces in addition when large number of failed test cases are reported by the test automation system recommending some representative test cases as a start for debugging can be helpful to programmers this paper proposes a clustering technique based on the information collected from the instrumented code in principle fixing bugs in one representative test case can fix its related failed test cases as well a case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach 2011 ieee

simulation approach the application of lean principles and agile project management techniques in the domain of large scale software product development has gained tremendous momentum over the last decade however a simple transfer of good practices from the automotive industry combined with experiences from agile development on a team level is not possible due to fundamental differences stemming from the particular domain specifics i e different types of products and components material versus immaterial goods knowledge work versus production systems as well as established business models especially team empowerment and the absence of a a hierarchical control on all levels impacts goal orientation and business optimization in such settings the design of adequate incentive schemes in order to align local optimization and opportunistic behavior with the overall strategy of the company is a crucial activity of central importance following an agent based simulation approach with reinforcement learning we i address the question of how information regarding backlog item dependencies is shared within and in between development teams on the product level subject to different incentive schemes we ii compare different incentive schemes ranging from individual to team based compensation based on our results we are iii able to provide recommendations on how to design such incentives what their effect is and how to chose an adequate development structure to foster overall software product development flow by means of more economic decisions and thus resulting in a shorter time to market for calibrating our simulation we rely on practical experience from a very large software company piloting and implementing lean and agile for about three years agent based simulation agile incentive lean performance one technique is not enough a comparison of vulnerability discovery techniques security vulnerabilities discovered later in the development cycle are more expensive to fix than those discovered early therefore software developers should strive to discover vulnerabilities as early as possible unfortunately the large size of code bases and lack of developer expertise can make discovering software vulnerabilities difficult to ease this difficulty many different types of techniques have been devised to aid developers in vulnerability discovery the goal of this research is to improve vulnerability detection by comparing the effectiveness of vulnerability discovery techniques and to provide specific recommendations to improve vulnerability discovery with these techniques we conducted a case study on two electronic health record systems to compare four discovery techniques systematic and exploratory manual penetration testing static analysis and automated penetration testing in our case study we found empirical evidence that no single technique discovered every type of vulnerability we discovered almost no individual vulnerabilities with multiple discovery techniques we also found that systematic manual penetration testing found the most design flaws while static analysis found the most implementation bugs finally we found the most effective vulnerability discovery technique in terms of vulnerabilities discovered per hour was automated penetration testing these results suggest that if one has limited time to preform vulnerability discovery one should conduct automated penetration testing to discover implementation bugs and systematic manual penetration testing to discover design flaws 2011 ieee blackbox testing penetration testing security static analysis vulnerability whitebox testing optimal design and development of software for design of substation grounding system role of substation is crucial in overall functionality of power system in any substation grounding system deserves considerable attention as far as performance and design are considered design of an effective grounding system is of very much importance because it deals with personnel safety and also operation and protection of equipments main purpose of this work is development of software optimal ground grid designer which gives safe and optimum design of substation grounding system this software has been designed using matlab as a mathematical tool methodology adopted for designing the grounding grid is as per ieee standard 80 2000 moreover this program also allows two layered soil modeling which is not given in ieee guide this program allows simple analysis of grounding system performance for given data and is able to recommend optimal design of the grounding system in the given conditions and safety constraints a design problem of grounding system design of 400 kv asoj gujarat substation has been solved using this software results obtained here are also compared with those obtained by using ground grid systems module of etap a close agreement is observed between the results obtained by both softwares hence the software developed herein effectively gives optimal design of substation grounding system in terms of cost effectiveness as well as safety for various grid geometries 2011 ieee electrical

system this attention to patent policy reflects a recognition of the increasing importance of intellectual property to u s innovation patent ownership is perceived as an incentive to the technological advancement that leads to economic growth as such the number of patent applications and grants has grown significantly as have the type and breadth of inventions that can be patented along with the expansion in the number and range of patents there are growing concerns over whether the current system is working efficiently and effectively several studies recommended patent reform and several bills have been introduced in recent congresses that would make significant alterations in current patent law other experts maintain that major changes in existing law are unnecessary and that while not perfect the patent process can and is adapting to technological progress at the present time the patent laws provide a system under which all inventions are subject to the same requirements of patentability regardless of the technical field in which they arose however inventors and innovative companies in different industries often hold divergent views concerning the importance of patents reflecting varying experiences with the patent system innovators in the biomedical sector tend to see patent protection as a critically important way to prohibit competitors from appropriating the results of a company s research and development efforts typically only a few often one or two patents cover a particular drug in contrast the nature of software development is such that inventions often are cumulative and new products generally embody numerous patentable inventions as a result distinct industries may react differently to patent reform proposals under consideration by congress

increasingly important option for reusing and disposing of effluent produced by intensive rural industries sewage treatment plants and domestic on site systems over the past few decades over this time regulatory controls on the environment have become more stringent as effluent irrigation schemes in queensland continue to be located in tropical and sub tropical areas often with conditions adverse to their successful establishment such as high rainfall and poor soils medli model for effluent disposal using land irrigation has been used by designers and regulators over the past 15 years to assess the environmental impact of effluent irrigation schemes in this paper the usefulness of the medli model over the past decade in effluent irrigation assessments is reviewed including what has performed well and what could be improved since its development by the cooperative research centre for waste management and pollution control ltd commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and the queensland department of primary industries now the department of environment and resource management medli has enjoyed reasonable success in its uptake and use by consultants regulators industry and universities around australia and overseas the majority of queensland effluent irrigation designs now use medli not the least reason being that it was recommended as the design tool in the queensland effluent reuse guidelines for both sewage treatment plants and animal industry enterprises it remains in use despite suffering the incompatibility problems associated with all legacy software developed pre windows 2000 its success has been attributed to a number of factors including the absence of a similar model that performs the same task the difficulty and cost of developing modelling software for such a small niche market clear benefits to a target user audience the scientific integrity of the model in terms of algorithms and peer review process low purchase cost and ongoing support provided by model developers themselves these factors and other lessons from our interaction with medli users will be discussed in the paper the critical issue for effluent irrigation scheme designers is not just one of predicting water nutrient and salt outcomes of a particular design but also is one of interpreting results in terms of performance criteria how do we interpret the results such as frequency of pond overtopping percentage of the effluent that is reused and nitrate concentration in the soil solution leachate in terms of sustainability what number is acceptable and what number is unacceptable it is our view that environmental protection policy and guidelines are needed to help address these questions and we introduce possible performance criteria to help determine if a model result is acceptable or unacceptable we discuss the application of medli to assess irrigation proposals with a particular focus on its use to assist enlightened environmental regulation in queensland a risk based policy framework is proposed to guide the assessment of effluent irrigation schemes in the future this is designed to help address the key issue of identifying non sustainable practice along with planned improvements in the modeling software application framework to support this approach effluent irrigation scheme design medli model performance criteria risk based assessment sustainability environmental decision support systems edss development challenges and best practices despite the perceived value of dss in informing environmental and natural resource management dss tools often fail to be adopted by intended end users by drawing together the experience of a global group of edss developers we have identified and assessed key challenges in edss development and offer recommendations to resolve them challenges related to engaging end users in edss development emphasise the need for a participatory process that embraces end users and stakeholders throughout the design and development process adoption challenges concerned with individual and organisational capacities to use edss and the match between edss and organisational goals can be overcome through the use of an internal champion to promote the edss at different levels of a target organisation co ordinate and build capacity within the organisation and ensure that developers maintain focus on developing edss which are relatively easy and inexpensive to use and update and which are perceived as such by the target users significant challenges exist in relation to ensuring edss longevity and financial sustainability such business challenges may be met through planning and design that considers the long term costs of training support and maintenance revenue generation and licensing by instituting processes which support communication and interactions and by employing software technology which enables easy model expansion and re use to gain an economy of scale and reduce development costs a final group of perhaps more problematic challenges relate to how the success of edss ought to be evaluated whilst success can be framed relatively easily in terms of interactions with end users difficulties of definition and measurability emerge in relation to the extent to which edss achieve intended outcomes to tackle the challenges described the authors provide a set of best practice recommendations concerned with promoting design for ease of use design for usefulness establishing trust and credibility promoting edss acceptance and starting simple and small in functionality terms following these recommendations should enhance the achievement of successful edss adoption but more importantly help facilitate the achievement of desirable social and environmental outcomes 2011 elsevier ltd adoption decision making edss environmental decision support systems information systems software development use a comprehensive systematic review of visitation models in adult critical care units within the context of patient and family centred care aim the aim of this review was to appraise and synthesise the best available evidence on visitation models used in adult intensive care units in acute care hospitals and to explicate their congruence with the core concepts of patientand family centred care pfcc methods the review considered both quantitative and qualitative studies on visitation models developed within the pfcc model in adult intensive care units in acute care hospitals the search strategy sought published and unpublished research papers limited to english for the years 1988 through 2009 an initial search of the joanna briggs institute for evidence based nursing and midwifery the cochrane library and pubmed s clinical inquiry find systematic review database was conducted followed by an analysis of key words contained in the title abstract and index terms following this an extensive three stage search was conducted using pubmed cinahl healthstar sciencedirect dissertation abstracts international dare psycinfo biomedcentral trip pre cinahl psycarticles psychology and behavioural sciences collection isi current contents science gov web of science web of knowledge scirus com website included was a hand search of reference lists of identified papers to capture all pertinent material as well as a search of relevant worldwide websites and search engines such as google scholar and the virginia henderson library of sigma theta tau international each paper was assessed independently by two reviewers for methodological quality prior to inclusion in the review using the appropriate critical appraisal instrument results findings from the qualitative studies were extracted and a synthesis conducted using the qari qualitative assessment and review instrument software developed by the joanna briggs institute one synthesis revealed that visiting hours were seen as guidelines for the benefit of nurse and patient rather than rules or policy due to the various types of designs in the available studies it was not possible to pool quantitative research study results into a statistical meta analysis because statistical pooling was not possible the findings are presented in a narrative form following this results are presented for their congruence with the principles of pfcc conclusion flexible visiting policies provide the ability to incorporate the concepts of pfcc into practice however nurses believe that while visiting is beneficial to patients open and or flexible visiting hours are an impediment to practice and increase their workload recommendations for best practice were formulated based on the outcomes and include visiting hours should be used as guidelines not rules that allow flexibility dependent upon individual patient family situation with regard to congruence with pfcc patient and family requests for information emerged as an

engineering thematic analysis is an approach that is often used for identifying analyzing and reporting patterns themes within data in primary qualitative research thematic synthesis draws on the principles of thematic analysis and identifies the recurring themes or issues from multiple studies interprets and explains these themes and draws conclusions in systematic reviews this paper conceptualizes the thematic synthesis approach in software engineering as a scientific inquiry involving five steps that parallel those of primary research the process and outcome associated with each step are described and illustrated with examples from systematic reviews in software engineering 2011 ieee evidence based and empirical software engineering research synthesis secondary research systematic review reusable models in industrial automation experiences in defining appropriate levels of granularity domain engineering approaches are widely used in the software engineering they focus on building reusable models in a domain at the institute of industrial automation and software engineering ias of the university of stuttgart a new domain engineering approach has been developed the approach considers entire industrial automation systems including hardware and software models that capture structure and behavior of entire systems have to be carefully tailored in order to be reusable the level of granularity deserves particular attention since too coarse or too fine grained reusable models discourage reuse this paper addresses the issue of finding appropriate levels of granularity and proposes a set of recommendations for determining appropriate levels of granularity for reusable models created during domain engineering 2011 ifac teaching students to learn to learn

bayesian network information system ontology mendel source code recommendation based on a genetic metaphor when evolving software systems developers spend a considerable amount of time understanding existing source code to successfully implement new or alter existing behavior developers need to answer questions such as which types and methods can i use to solve this task or should my implementation follow particular naming or structural conventions in this paper we present mendel a source code recommendation tool that aids developers in answering such questions based on the entity the developer currently browses the tool employs a genetics inspired metaphor to analyze source code entities related to the current working context and provides its user with a number of recommended properties naming conventions used types invoked messages etc that the source code entity currently being worked on should exhibit an initial validation of mendel seems to confirm the potential of our approach 2011 ieee mining cause effect chains from version histories software reliability is heavily impacted by software changes ow do these changes relate to each other by analyzing the impacted

an alternative feedback tool for lecturers to enhance teaching and learning in higher education learning environment managing students learning means managing emotions this paper presents the efforts in recognizing student s emotion to promote interactive teaching learning atmosphere in a higher education environment as to now not many variety of tools provided to help lecturers to assess their teaching our research suggests a new system to help lecturers to identify whether their teaching style has positive impact on students by recognizing student s emotion in the class this system propose the positive class emotion as result of positive student s emotion to encourage lecturers to retain their teaching style or vice versa this software is considered as emotion based system to enhance teaching and learning in this paper we compare some of the existing works and identify how emotions can be modeled in order to enhance the system services and response by suggesting meaningful

increasing attention in digital libraries since they assist scholars to find the most appropriate articles however a major problem of such systems is that they don t subsume user background knowledge into the recommendation process and scholars have to manually sift irrelevant articles obtained in response of queries therefore a great challenging task is how to include scholar s knowledge into personalization process and filter out articles accordingly to address this problem a novel cascade recommender framework which incorporates scholar s background knowledge using ontological concepts into the user profiles is proposed the framework exploits standard odp structure as ontology modeling as well as lexicographic database wordnet for concept disambiguation the primary experiment over citeseerx digital library indicates an increase in user satisfaction 2011 ieee background knowledge citeseerx digital library ontology recommender system user profile approach to introducing a statistical quality control this paper describes some examples and points about implementing a statistical quality control in developing business systems in sumitomo electric industries ltd and sumitomo electric information systems co ltd although the x r chart is often used in statistical quality control it is recommended to introduce the u chart if defects are to be controlled in future if a defect detection process such as a review or a test does not reach a statistical steady state that indicates a process is stable on the control chart an appropriate control could be conducted by not only further standardizing the process but also reviewing the definition of size indicators quality prediction can be made possible by accumulating defect data collected to create a control chart and analyzing the distributions of introduced defect densities at an organization level if the accuracy of quality prediction is low it can be enhanced by carrying out improvements to narrow the widths of distributions of introduced defect densities 2011 ieee recommending component by citation a semi supervised approach for determination reusing existing components can help developers improve the development productivity as well as reduce the cost reuse repositories in this scenario act as a fundamental facility for acquiring needed components while retrieving components in reuse repositories developers often face the problem of choosing components from candidates that provide similar functionalities to address the problem this paper proposes a semi supervised method to recommend developers components in reuse repositories different from existing rating based recommendation approaches that often suffer from the lack of user ratings our approach calculates the recommendation probabilities of components based on their citations on the internet the citations are acquired through the websites called host in this paper that are associated with the components using a random walk algorithm the associations between components and hosts are explored with recommendable components identified we implemented our approach in a prototyping system based on which we conducted an experimental study to evaluate our approach the experimental results demonstrate that our approach can accurately recommend components and thus has the potential to assist developers in reuse

recommendations during a live user interaction and they have achieved widespread success in electronic commerce nowadays in many personalized recommender systems collaborative filtering algorithm is the most famous technique and especially in collaborative filtering methods neighborhood formation is an essential algorithm component in order to make a recommendation in collaborative filtering algorithm it is required to form a set of users sharing similar interests to the target user but traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm does not consider the evolution of user interest when finding the nearest neighbors in different time periods and the recommendation results can not reflect the user s true interests for this reason a personalized collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on user interest evolution is given this recommendation approach takes into account the important factor that user interests changes over time 2011 springer verlag

important resources for expressing correct application programming interface api usages however many framework and library apis fail in offering sufficient code examples in corresponding api documentations this is because constructing proper code examples for documentation purpose takes significant developers efforts to reduce such effort this work proposes a methodology proper doc that recommends proper code examples for documentation purpose proper doc accepts queries from api developers and utilizes code search engines cses to collect corresponding code example candidates the structural and conceptual links between api elements are captured from the api implementation and available api documents to guide candidate recommendation during recommendation proper doc groups collected candidates based on involved api types for distinguishing different api usages to assist api developers in selecting proper candidates a diagrammatic presentation and three code example appropriateness metrics are also developed in proper doc two case studies on eclipse jdt framework are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of proper doc 2011 ieee api usage code example documentation framework explicit domain modelling in video games the state of the art in software engineering for game engines recommends the use of a component based software architecture for managing the entities in a game a component based architecture facilitates the definition of new types of entities as collections of components that provide basic pieces of functionality providing a flexible software that can adapt to changes in game design however such flexibility comes with a price both in terms of software understanding and error checking a game where entity types are just run time concepts is harder to understand than one with an explicit hierarchy of entity types and error checking that in a more traditional inheritance based architecture would come from type safety at compile time is now lost to alleviate these problems a component based architecture employs blueprints external data files that specify the particular combination of components for every entity type in this paper we propose an extension to the componentbased architecture substituting blueprints with a full fledged domain model in owl including a description of the entities its attributes and components along with the messages they exchange we also describe authoring tools for building such a model and show how the model improves software understanding and error checking copyright 2011 acm progress so far in the development of lvc coalition training interoperability standards for the royal australian air force the royal australian air force raaf relies mainly on stand alone simulators and operational platform training for combat crew readiness large scale operational exercises provide opportunities to train crews in team and inter team skills however cost fatigue life concerns range site capabilities weather and frequency of event limitations make this only a partial solution to crew readiness training with little network capability a significant gap exists between training obtained using stand alone simulators and training obtained using live training exercises for combat crews alternative training methods such as usaf distributed mission operations dmo synthetic range live virtual and constructive lvc training need to be considered to prepare and maintain raaf combat crew readiness for joint and coalition team operations the concept of the synthetic range including the synthetic range interoperability model provides a simplified way of understanding how lvc systems can interoperate the long term objective of this work is that every lvc system that may need to interoperate is acquired with a set of synthetic range interoperability model capabilities that support the same set of corporate interoperability standards to enable a common level of lvc

system testing this research focuses on constructing a mathematical model to predict functional defects in system testing by applying six sigma approach the motivation behind this effort is to achieve zero known post release defects of the software delivered to end user besides serving as the indicator of optimizing testing process predicting functional defects at the start of testing allows testing team to put comprehensive test coverage find as many defects as possible and determine when to stop testing so that all known defects are contained within testing phase design for six sigma dfss is chosen as the methodology as it emphasizes on customers requirement and systematic techniques to build the model historical data becomes the crucial elements in this study metrics related to potential predictors and their relationships for the model are identified which focuses on metrics in phases prior to testing phase repeatability and capability of testers consistency in finding defects are analyzed type of data required are also identified and collected the metrics of selected predictors which incorporate testing and development metrics are measured against total functional defects using multiple regression analysis the best and most significant mathematical model generated by the regression analysis is selected as the proposed prediction model for functional defects in system testing phase validation of the model is then conducted to prove the goodness for implementation recommendation and future research work are provided at the end of this study 2011 ieee defect

development process many companies have adopted system development methodologies various evaluation methods and frameworks exist in the literature to assist companies during their adoption phase however a need was identified to evaluate the efficiency of a system development methodology after adoption in an era where there is a reappraisal of the usefulness of system development methodologies it is essential to have a valid and reliable method of evaluation the aim of this paper is to propose an evaluation model to measure post implementation efficiency of a software development methodology data envelopment analysis a linear programming method is investigated as a means to evaluate efficiency of a sdm after adoption this paper focus on the scrum software development methodology as it is a popular methodology in use today with data envelopment analysis it is possible to classify different companies use of scrum as efficient or inefficient the results also make it

researchers and practitioners frequently describe a situation in which the object oriented oo approach strongly supports the design and coding phases of software development but only weakly supports the analysis phase such observations conflict with impressions imparted by textbooks and training programs this article examines whether object oriented analysis ooa theory has been deployed in practice with or without support of computer aided software engineering tools or whether it exists only in theory this study explores 54 projects diverse in scope and topic all of which were implemented using object oriented tools the study shows that practitioners haven t widely adopted the theoretically popular ooa and suggests a cost benefit perspective arguing that ooa fails to attract practitioners because of a low ratio of costs to benefits relative to other methodologies in particular practitioners perceive the cost of system modeling using ooa methodologies and uml diagrams as high relative to its benefits the authors present of recommendations to reduce costs and increase benefits in ooa 2010 ieee cost benefit object oriented analysis software software

with respect to a system under development previous work has established this as a useful and cost effective way of exploration and learning of the design space of a system and in addressing issues regarding quality attributes architectural risks and the problem of knowledge transfer and conformance however the actual industrial use of architectural prototyping has not been thoroughly researched so far in this article we report from three studies of architectural prototyping in practice first we report findings from an ethnographic study of practicing software architects secondly we report from a focus group on architectural prototyping involving architects from four companies and thirdly we report from a survey study of 20 practicing software architects and software developers our findings indicate that architectural prototyping plays an important and frequent role in resolving problems experimentally but less so in exploring alternative solutions furthermore architectural

research and development efforts typically only a few often one or two patents cover a particular drug in contrast the nature of software development is such that inventions often are cumulative and new products generally embody numerous patentable inventions as a result distinct industries may react differently to patent reform proposals under consideration by congress the impact of diverse information systems environments on information quality a design science approach information quality is an ever increasing problem that many organisations must contend with despite investment in both technology and refinement of information systems the problem continues to escalate the introduction of test driven software development methodologies and increased user proficiency has not improved the situation the use of information systems for more and more business processes at all levels within a multitude of organisations has highlighted the ever increasing problems of information quality the financial implications are enormous prompting research from many disparate disciplines to examine the concept of information quality information system deployment has in recent years undergone radical change the traditional deployment where the architecture user and access device were known at the time of information systems development have been replaced by a much more diverse environment these diverse environments include web interfaces traditional client server and a revolution with respect to mobile devices the challenges of measuring information quality where diverse information systems access the same underlying databases are significant initial research with respect to information quality concentrated on accuracy and completeness of information seminal work in the area of information quality led to the development of wang and strongs information quality framework that expanded the number of individual dimensions to fifteen the sum of which gave an overall level of information quality for an information system however little if any research has examined the impact of diverse information systems environments several frameworks based on wang and strongs original work have been developed in an effort to cater for new and evolving information systems the expansion of frameworks across a large number of domains presents problems with respect to framework choice appropriateness validity and eventually too many diverse frameworks to allow for practical application in diverse information systems environment in order to overcome these problems this research proposes the construction of a method that allows for the application of wang and strongs information quality framework in diverse information systems environment this method clearly indicates that diverse environments accessing the same information present different levels of information quality in particular some dimensions have more significance in non traditional environments and as a consequence allowances must be made for this this in turn impacts on the traditional total weighted sum measurement of information quality dimensions we recommend that assignment of weightings for individual dimensions in diverse environments our method contributes to information quality as field of research by allowing for refinement of the application of information quality frameworks in diverse information systems environments and provides the basis fore consolidation of information quality frameworks design science information quality information quality frameworks information systems developing an academic curriculum in information operations the first steps in their 2006 article information operations education lessons learned from information assurance schou kuehl and armistead outlined the need for an academic response to the development of a better methodology of an information operations io education program these academics recommended fourteen areas of specific effort in addition to the recommendation for a scholarship program there was also a call to establish specific io academic programs while a large number of universities have developed more specialized information assurance ia or computer security programs the broader aspects of io are still not seen as worthy of study by the academic community among other things these academics posed two fundamental questions 1 why does this dichotomy exist 2 why is there such a broad consensus on the need for this kind of education and training by the united states military when the academic community does not offer equivalent education or classes an effective response requires not only a curriculum but a shared body of knowledge and a shared language or taxonomy the proposed technique suggested in that earlier paper used a subset of the edacum product that is part of an established set of bodies of knowledge for the computer security and information assurance ia disciplines the edacum electronic develop a curriculum technique and processes uses proprietary software developed at an american university that now houses one of the largest repositories of ia knowledge base data these data are now being re mapped into io knowledge domains this is the beginning of establishing a taxonomic classification of the io discipline is a critical first step in developing a structured curriculum as expected preliminary results show that there is a high commonality with the information assurance discipline however the categories used to classify the knowledge items have a different basis elements of the preliminary study are being mapped currently into candidate course material this developmental route was taken because ia and io are two sides of the same coin from that original academic proposal an international project to select key knowledge items that are shared between io and ia has begun in this further efforts to continue this project will be described isc curriculum

software development increases the need to find and connect developers with relevant expertise existing recommendation systems typically model expertise based on file changes implementation expertise while these approaches have shown success they require a substantial recorded history of development for a project previously we have proposed the concept of usage expertise i e expertise manifested through the act of calling using a method in this paper we assess the viability of this concept by evaluating expert recommendations for the aspectj and eclipse projects we find that both usage and implementation expertise have comparable levels of accuracy which suggests that usage expertise may be used as a substitute measure we also find a notable overlap of method calls across both projects which suggests that usage expertise can be leveraged to recommend experts from different projects and thus for projects with little or no history patterns and tools for improving framework

paper recommends developing a customized ide based on open source software we present a case study of developing such an ide for the languages c python and javascript we used several open source projects with varying project status as a basis for our development we analyzed developer communication within these open source projects and identified the benefits and the potential pitfalls for the

involvement in each phase of the software development life cycle based on dynamic system development method the model recommends developing a feasibility study that is mainly concerned with the technical ability to build the required software and judging the domain of the project to involve the customer frequently and effectively in project we discuss the customer role in each of the main

survey on hci considerations in the software development life cycle from practitioner s perspective in the human computer interaction hci literature it has been recommended that user involvement and hci considerations in the software development life cycle sdlc is an important mechanism for a successful system implementation however it is still unclear to what extend do the user involvement and hci consideration have been adopted by software development practitioners this paper reports the results of a survey on the importance of hci in sdlc from practitioner perspective the survey involves thirty two software designers the objectives of the study are to identify the state of user involvement in sdlc and to identify the hci elements that have been addressed results have found that many of practitioners involve users in sdlc but majority are only during the requirement analysis phase the findings also reveal that hci elements on functionality are well addressed however the non functionality elements such as cultural and affective values have not been emphasized by practitioners the paper concludes with recommendation to further investigate on user awareness on the

requirements project and preliminary results in distributed software development geographical and temporal distances turn communication inefficient and affect the various team s perceptions levels proximity activity awareness process and perspective the low level of perception turns the task of expert location hard and not being able to quickly locate the experts in the source code during the implementation makes the project slower consequently delaying its schedule this paper proposes presley a tool to reduce these delays through identification and recommendation of experts in some areas of the source code using the project communication decreasing the waiting time for help we also present preliminary results which show the practical potential of our approach 2009 ieee distributed software development expert recommender system knowledge management best practices guidelines for agile requirements engineering practices developing software that meets the customers or stakeholders needs and expectation is the ultimate goal of the software development methodology to meet their need we have to perform requirement engineering which helps to identify and structure requirements in traditional software development methods end users or stakeholders predefined their requirements and sent to the development team to analysis and negotiation to produce requirement specification in many cases it is risky or very difficult and not economical to produce a complete verifiable set of requirements traditional software development has a problem to deal with requirement change after careful analysis and negotiation this problem is well tackled by the agile practices as it s recommends an on site customer to represents their requirements through user stories on story cards generally customers have rarely a general picture of the requirements or system in their mind which leads problems related to requirements like requirements conflicts missing requirements and ambiguous requirements etc and does not address non functional requirements from exploration phase this chapter introduces best knowledge based guidelines for agile requirements engineering to enhance the quality of requirements story cards 2010 igi global an integrated quality assurance framework for specifying business information systems the software specification acts as a bridge between customers architects software developers and testers if information gets lost or distorted when building this bridge the wrong system will be built or the system will not be built in time and budget or both standards and recommendations give advice on how to structure specifications or check software engineering artefacts with reviews or inspections but these constructive and analytical approaches are not well integrated with each other moreover they are often too generic to efficiently support the specification of particular system types in this paper we present the integrated specification framework of capgemini sd m it consists of our specification method for business information systems bis and its concerted analytical counterpart the specification quality gate since this framework is tailored to the specification of large bis it allows a quick ramp up phase for software engineering projects without the need for extensive tailoring or extension coping with cultural and maturity inequality in offshore outsourcing is minimizing interaction the solution many companies consider and undertake outsourcing of their software development activities often information systems development is outsourced to vendors in different cultures or with a different level of software process maturity recommendations for managing such outsourcing arrangements typically involve that client and vendor should increase interaction learn more about the culture of the other part communicate more form partnerships and the like we have studied a client that did the opposite with a successful outcome based on a case study we lay out the story of how interaction between client and vendor on purpose was minimized what mechanisms were used what worked and what did not we conclude that minimizing interaction can be a viable strategy to follow when clients face large cultural and maturity inequality in offshoring their software development activities culture extra costs maturity minimal interaction strategy offshore outsourcing the influence of offshore development on strategies for developing china s software industry this article recommends strategies to develop china s software industry based on our analysis of the recent technology transfer to chinese software firms from japan li and gao 2003 recommended that the chinese software industry focus on its domestic software service market however since the end of the 1990s chinese software firms have obtained a significant amount of technology contract work from japan including coding testing and design chinese firms have been increasing their design skills through this joint software development with japan as a result offshore software development from japan has helped chinese software firms acquire advanced technology we conclude that the chinese software industry should focus on both its domestic software service market and the export of software services offshore software development technology transfer a survey of model driven testing techniques the model driven approach to software development has not only changed the way software systems are built and maintained but also the way they are tested for such systems a model based testing approach is much recommended since it is aligned with the new model driven development paradigm that favors models over code with the objective being to reduce time to market while improving product quality there has been a noticeable increase in the number of model driven testing techniques in recent years although these techniques have a common objective they tend to vary significantly in their design in this paper we discuss the model driven testing techniques presented in 15 different studies we compare these techniques according to specific criteria including the modeling language used to represent the system design artifacts the ability to automatically generate test cases the testing target and tool support 2009 ieee model driven software engineering software quality assurance software testing test case generation the use of cats and case based teaching for dealing with different levels of abstractions software development is a highly knowledgeintensive and collaborative activity problem resolution processes are performed iteratively during software development some students as novice software designers possess obstacles that impede the problem solving process and often lead to an inability to solve problems correctly students are not proficient in identifying abstractions at different levels as required by distributed systems the process of generalization by reducing the information content of a concept or of an observable phenomenon is hard to master for novices who rely on surface features implementations of poorly designed distributed processes can exhibit a bizarre behavior we use an inductive learning approach using several classroom assessment techniques cat to assess how well students are learning the learning approach is a spiral approach based on reflection and knowledge collaboration for problem resolution we introduce each level of abstraction with concrete practical examples of a case study relating the abstract concept to students concrete experiences the techniques of argumentative essay writing recommended for undergraduates in liberal

elicitation requirements elicitation has long been recognized as a crucial activity in any software development project unfortunately the traditional elicitation practices do not scale well when applied to larger projects where knowledge is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed stakeholders as a result new distributed requirements elicitation tools have started to surface such as online forums and wiki pages in our previous work we introduced a framework for supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders the framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view conflicts interests and tradeoffs are identified as early as possible in this paper we present two substantial enhancements to the recommender system component of this framework and demonstrate through experiments how they improve the quality of the recommendations 2009 ieee some common pitfalls in the design of ontology driven information systems ontologies are the mean proposed by the semantic web to manage the knowledge of a system in the software development industry however there is another de facto standard set of modeling techniques methodologies and tools reasons for that issue might include technological challenges still to be solved but also the need of a deep understanding of ontology modeling and the role that the ontology itself should play in this paper we show that 1 building an ontology is an error prone task that might hide unexpected difficulties even when the ontology is apparently complete and correct and 2 there is a tendency to misunderstand the role of ontologies when compared to other technologies such as relational databases forgetting the benefits and strengths of combining both for such a task we

actions prediction for ontology based browsing recommendations debugadvisor a recommender system for debugging in large software development projects when a programmer is assigned a bug to fix she typically spends a lot of time searching in an ad hoc manner for instances from the past where similar bugs have been debugged analyzed and resolved systematic search tools that allow the programmer to express the context of the current bug and search through diverse data repositories associated with large projects can greatly improve the productivity of debugging this paper presents the design implementation and experience from such a search tool called debugadvisor the context of a bug includes all the information a programmer has about the bug including natural language text textual rendering of core dumps debugger output etc our key insight is to allow the programmer to collate this entire context as a query to search for related information thus debugadvisor allows the programmer to search using a fat query which could be kilobytes of structured and unstructured data describing the contextual information for the current bug information retrieval in the presence of fat queries and variegated data repositories all of which contain a mix of structured and unstructured data is a challenging problem we present novel ideas to solve this problem we have deployed debugadvisor to over 100 users inside microsoft in addition to standard metrics such as precision and recall we present extensive qualitative and quantitative feedback from our users copyright 2009

investigate the participation dynamics in a social network particularly in an online open source community called ohloh through a rest based api we collected information about 11 530 open source software projects involving 94 330 developers using social network analysis and statistical analysis methods we examine a set of social and technical factors in the ohloh dataset which we define as the determinants that significantly influence the developers participation choices we found that the determinants include 1 homophily in programming language 2 project mutual acquaintance and 3

of accumulated knowledge from this point of view the authors think that guidance of learners in self assessment activity must be an important goal of e learning environment developers the scope of the chapter is to present a recommender software system that runs along the e learning platform the recommender software system improves the effectiveness of self assessment activities the activities performed by learners represent the input data and the machine learning algorithms are used within the business logic of the recommender software system that runs along the e learning platform the output of the recommender software system is represented by advice given to learners in order to improve the effectiveness of self assessment process the methodology for obtaining improvement of self assessment is based on embedding knowledge management into the business logic of the e learning platform naive bayes classifier is used as machine learning algorithm for obtaining the resources e g questions chapters and concepts that need to be further accessed by learners the analysis is accomplished for disciplines that are well structured according to a concept map the input data set for the

development research center at software engineering department university of craiova monitoring student activities is accomplished through various techniques like creating log files or adding records into a table from a database the logging facilities are embedded in the business logic of the e learning platform the e learning platform is based on a software development framework that uses only

reuse of multi resolution physical models the reuse of mathematical models of physical phenomena here called physical models within simulations is attractive because it has the potential of improving simulation results while reducing implementation and testing work in practice however it can be complicated to reuse a model that was originally developed for other studies and applications it becomes even more difficult when multiple stakeholders have different ideas on how to use and extend the physical model an attractive approach to deal with this problem is to develop and maintain a multi resolution physical model that can be reused for different purposes a multi resolution model is a model that represents a system or phenomenon at different levels of fidelity simultaneously on the process side such an approach requires a policy for managing the use the support and the development of the multi resolution physical model on the more technical side a multi resolution physical model requires a model specification that maintains all internal and external relationships while providing interoperability focusing on the reusability of physical models this paper presents and analyzes two examples of multi resolution physical models from different domains and discusses how they are used in different simulations the examples concern the modeling and use of 1 a missile model including its different components and 2 a signal propagation model in an underwater environment the examples show the global approach of how multi resolution physical models can be used based on the experiences of modeling and simulation experts and physical modeling experts this paper presents our guidelines and recommendations on how to facilitate the use of multi resolution physical models in simulations these guidelines are structured according to the different software development phases and help to improve the reusability and utility of physical models meta modeling multi resolution

engineering variance analysis in software fault prediction models software fault prediction models play an important role in software quality assurance they identify software subsystems modules components classes or files which are likely to contain faults these subsystems in turn receive additional resources for verification and validation activities fault prediction models are binary classifiers typically developed using one of the supervised learning techniques from either a subset of the fault data from the current project or from a similar past project in practice it is critical that such models provide a reliable prediction performance on the data not used in training variance is an important reliability indicator of software fault prediction models however variance is often ignored or barely mentioned in many published studies in this paper through the analysis of twelve data sets from a public software engineering repository from the perspective of variance we explore the following five questions regarding fault prediction models 1 do different types of classification performance measures exhibit different variance 2 does the size of the data set imply a more or less accurate prediction performance 3 does the size of training subset impact model s stability 4 do different classifiers consistently exhibit different performance in terms of model s variance 5 are there differences between variance from 1000 runs and 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation experiments our results indicate that variance is a very important factor in understanding fault prediction models and we recommend the best practice for reporting variance in empirical software engineering studies evaluation of uml in practice experiences in a traffic management systems

management systems using the object oriented paradigm and uml as the visual modeling language our hypothesis is that uml has some difficulties drawbacks in certain system development phases and activities many of these problems were reported in the literature normally after applying uml to one project and or studying the language s formal specifications and comparing with other languages unfortunately few publications are based on surveys and interviews with practitioners i e the developers and project managers that are using uml in real projects and are frequently facing these problems as a matter of fact some relevant questions were not fully addressed in past research mainly related to uml problems in practice the purpose of this text is to report the main findings and the proposed improvements based on other methods languages or even considering uml diagrams that are not often used the research methodology involved surveys interviews and action research with a

heidelberg 2009 automatic code generator block sequencing coq proof assistant formal verification software engineering improving api usage through automatic detection of redundant code software projects often rely on third party libraries made accessible through application programming interfaces apis we have observed many cases where apis are used in ways that are not the most effective we developed a technique and tool support to automatically detect such patterns of api usage in software projects the main hypothesis underlying our technique is that client code imitating the behavior of an api method without calling it may not be using the api effectively because it could instead call the method it imitates our technique involves analyzing software systems to detect cases of api method imitations in addition to warning developers of potentially reimplemented api methods we also indicate how to improve the use of the api applying our approach on 10 java systems revealed over 400 actual cases of potentially suboptimal api usage leading to many improvements to the quality of the code we studied 2009 ieee api usage code analysis code quality recommendation system automatically recommending triage decisions for pragmatic reuse tasks planning a complex software modification task imposes a high cognitive burden on developers who must juggle navigating the software understanding what they see with respect to their task and deciding how their task should be performed given what they have discovered pragmatic reuse tasks where source code is reused in a white box fashion is an example of a complex and error prone modification task the developer must plan out which portions of a system to reuse extract the code and integrate it into their own system in this paper we present a recommendation system that automates some aspects of the planning process undertaken by developers during pragmatic reuse tasks in a retroactive evaluation we demonstrate that our technique was able to provide the correct recommendation 64 of the time and was incorrect 25 of the time our case study suggests that developer investigative behaviour is positively influenced by the use of the recommendation system 2009 ieee code analysis cost pragmatic software reuse tasks recommendation systems retroactive evaluation source structural relevance triage decisions automatically capturing source code context of nl queries for software maintenance and reuse as software systems continue to grow and evolve locating code for maintenance and reuse tasks becomes increasingly difficult existing static code search techniques using natural language queries provide little support to help developers determine whether search results are relevant and few recommend alternative words to help developers reformulate poor queries in this paper we present a novel approach that automatically extracts natural language phrases from source code identifiers and categorizes the phrases and search results in a hierarchy our contextual search approach allows developers to explore the word usage in a piece of software helping them to quickly identify relevant program elements for investigation or to quickly recognize alternative words for query reformulation an empirical evaluation of 22 developers reveals that our contextual search approach significantly outperforms the most closely related technique in terms of effort and effectiveness 2009 ieee study case distributed groupware and collaborative web agents although groupware and collaborative web agents have been researched during the last few years but this combination have not been widely researched groupware applications would seem to have a lot of benefit by leveraging off of web service standards one of them is support web computing to support access with web browsers whereas the goal of web computing has been supported group work on the web web services support for groupware which has the goal to provide interoperability between many groupware systems besides that web search tools is also supported by groupware system but the previous web search tool do not utilize previous search experiences of others to improve performance for the current user in this paper we present a collaborative web agent designed to enable across user collaboration in web search and

interest to the customer collaborative filtering cf algorithm plays an important role in the recommendation system item based collaborative filtering is widely employed over user based algorithm due to the computational complexity item similarity calculation is the first but the most important step in item based collaborative filtering algorithm in this paper we analyze and implement several item similarity measurements in p tree format to netflix prize data set our experiments suggest that adjusted cosine based similarity provides much better rmse than other item based similarity measurements the experimental results provide a guideline for our next step for netflix prize a guideline engine for knowledge management in clinical decision support systems cdsss the application of scientific methodology to clinical practice is typically realized through recommendations policies and protocols represented as clinical practice guidelines cpgs cpgs have the purpose to help the clinicians in their choices and to improve the patient care process currently there have been considerable efforts in digital cpgs for their application to build clinical decision support systems cdsss in order to deploy them in several hospitals the representation of guidelines and their introduction in clinical information system cis can lead to efficient clinical decision support systems cdss however this poses several interesting challenges as it involves problems of knowledge representation inference workflow definition access to unstructured databases of medical records and others in this paper we describe the architecture of the guideline engine as part of the kon 3 knowledge on oncology through ontology project we use a semantic web approach employing a domain ontology a patient ontology

elicitation in large scale software projects in large and complex software projects the knowledge needed to elicit requirements and specify the functional and behavioral properties can be dispersed across many thousands of stakeholders unfortunately traditional requirements engineering techniques which were primarily designed to support face to face meetings do not scale well to handle the needs of larger projects we therefore propose a semi automated requirements elicitation framework which uses data mining techniques and recommender system technologies to facilitate stakeholder collaboration in a large scale distributed project our proposed recommender model is a hybrid one designed to manage the placement of stakeholders into highly focused discussion forums where they can work collaboratively to generate requirements in our approach statements of need are first gathered from the project stakeholders unsupervised clustering techniques are then used to identify cohesive and finely grained themes and a users profile is constructed according to the interests of the stakeholders in each of these themes this profile feeds information to a collaborative recommender which predicts stakeholders interests in additional forums the validity and effectiveness of the proposed recommendation framework is evaluated through a series of experiments using feature requests from three software systems copyright 2009 acm collaborative recommender systems large scale software engineering requirements clustering 12 steps to successful knowledge management implementation knowledge management initiatives often fail to live up to expectations and many result in failure unfortunately many knowledge management initiatives fail because they have been introduced simply because knowledge management has been recognised by senior management as a good thing and something their competitors are undertaking this can lead to a knowledge management being appointed without any clear direction and knowledge management initiatives being undertaken without any clear purpose or measurable target criteria to overcome these problems a twelve step methodology for knowledge management implementation is presented illustrated with a series of small case studies starting from a problem audit subsequent steps ensure a baseline measure for improvement is identified and a comprehensive costed solution to a recognised problem is designed which is capable of gaining buy in from both management and the system users the system is designed with user involvement and must consider the operation of the proposed system as well as the implementation subsequent to the implementation a review process involving the identification of measurable cost benefits can become the basis for future expansion and roll out of knowledge management and can become the first steps in the building of a comprehensive knowledge environment the case studies illustrate the value of each step in the methodology with examples of good and bad practice drawn from the author s previously published experiences this paper brings the lessons from these case studies together to form the twelve step methodology which ensures knowledge management is implemented using sound business principles of cost benefit analysis and return on investment and established engineering principles of breaking larger projects into smaller projects carried out incrementally with testing carried out at each stage it is recommended that companies follow these principles and the proposed twelve step methodology in order to achieve successful knowledge management implementation in their own environment business case failure software engineering success systems implementation a recommended market research based approach for small software companies for improving systematic reuse capability in delivering customized software solutions small software companies can neither be typical software product company like microsoft nor afford to develop each customized application for individual customerfrom clean slate without taking into consideration of reuse systematic reuse is an opportunity of continued cost reduction and quality improvement in software delivery small software companies in bangladesh and the rest of the world need to exploit this opportunity to deal with ever increasing competitive market forces systematic reuse largely depends on the scope of delivering customized software applications in the same market segment repeatedly to multiple customers understanding the market for defining the generic software application concept which will be customized for meeting individual customer s demand and expectation in a profitable manner is difficult thorough market analysis provides basic inputs for defining generic product concept for launching customized software application for delivering services targeting suitable market segments choosing an appropriate market research methodology is challenging within the context where the market forces for software application are rapidly changing and a successful new service launch around customized application delivery by targeting an attractive market segment is thought by many to be the key to business growth and profitability the problem ofestablishing a successful new business around a generic software product concept is not challenging because of shortage of ideas but rather problems exist in proper analysis of the market studying different market segments targeting the attractive segment minimizing development expenses pricing product appropriately adopting reuse capability for continued price reduction and quality improvement to deal with evolving market forces and marketing the new product this paper therefore suggests the application of market research methodology to screen new software application ideas based on market analysis and shows how a software company can combine market research with new software product development to provide exciting customized software applications that better meet consumer requirements and make the company profitable both state of art review and filed investigation have been performed to assess global as well as local practices of market research methodology in different industries including the software industry upon analysis of review outputs and field level investigation findings a set of recommendations for practicing market research methodology for small software companies have been derived for improving systematic reuse

engineering product line approach small software companies software market research software reuse systematic reuse capability trends and discoveries of the computing educators oral history project this panel will present concrete results from initial analyses of the growing body of interviews in the computing educators oral history project ceohp we will present a brief background of the project with the bulk of the panel focusing on issues related to the techniques and results that have been explored during these early stages of the project many histories have been written about various aspects of computing including computers from the middle ages to modern times application areas e g 4 the software industry e g 3 male computer scientists e g 6 and female computer scientists e g 5 many of these histories have been written from the viewpoints of the actors themselves with the underlying data collected in the form of oral histories yet despite the significant role that computing and technology have played in societal developments over recent decades very little has been written about the people who have taught the ideas of computing to the computing workforce by understanding the histories of individuals who have educated the workforce over the past few decades we can gain insights into these years of rapid change and support educators as they plan for the future from its start in 2005 a key impetus for ceohp was the realization that many leading computing educators were nearing the ends of their careers while the initial focus of ceohp was women who helped pioneer computing education at a time when there was a greater proportion of women in the field the focus soon expanded to include the stories of men ceohp s leadership realized that the collection would best achieve its potential by providing a strong basis for comparison and contrast that is through balance in the interviews across a wide variety of characteristics including gender in addition to the goal of preserving the history of pioneers a goal for the ceohp collection has been to create a body of narratives that can help attract students particularly women and other underrepresented minorities to computing education much of the groundwork for ceohp was laid by two working groups the first at iticse 2005 2 and the second at iticse 2008 1 the main task of the most recent working group was to start the process of systematically analyzing the interviews collected up to june 2008 even at this early stage of analysis several interesting trends have emerged for example many interviewees did not follow the socalled traditional path into computing education some doubled back or followed a round about path into their career we also found that for many of these interviewees family background had a significant impact on the initial choice of career path other interesting insights that have emerged from the analyses are related to the founding and growth of computing departments the development of computing curricula and how these computing curricula have changed over the years in this panel we will examine a variety of themes that have emerged during our early analyses these results will be of particular interest to the sigcse community as sigcse celebrates its 40th anniversary many of the individuals already included in the ceohp collection have been involved with sigcse since it began this panel will also offer insights of interest to members of the academic community who hope to increase enrollments in computing fields and to scholars studying women s advancement in academic computing while it is a sigcse recommendation that a panel be limited to four persons including the moderator we feel strongly that the broadranging value of the interviews will be more visible if we show all four of the analyses described herein we also believe that providing an overview of our future plans will help us to expand the dialog and elicit the ideas of the audience the majority of whom are likely to identify strongly with our interviewees the moderator will carefully limit panelists to 5 6 minutes leaving a generous 35 40 minutes for audience questions and answers computing education history gender issues oral history pathways qualitative analysis teaching philosophy wordle easing team politics in agile usability a concept mapping approach team politics complicate software projects they cause internal conflicts that can not only cost a software team time and money but may also detract from the needs of the product s end users in this paper we explore the use of concept maps as a means of mitigating such team conflicts approaching agile usability through the lens of distributed cognition concept mapping could improve team communications we conducted interviews with eleven practitioners from three local software development companies to gain preliminary evidence of the practicality of the approach participants were questioned about their challenges in agile development and about their overall impressions of a concept mapping approach we asked about the practicality and acceptability of implementing such a methodology along with general concerns and recommendations results indicate that there is a need for improvement in agile usability and a concept mapping approach is promising for addressing existing concerns with refinement of the method and the development of the proper tools this approach has great potential to improve team interaction in agile usability environments agile usability concept mapping dcog distributed cognition modeling and predicting software failure costs for software the costs of failures are not clearly understood often these costs disappear in the costs of testing the general developments costs or the operating expenses in a general manufacturing context the british standard bs 6143 2 1990 classifies quality related costs into prevention costs appraisal costs and failure costs it furthermore recommends to identify the activities carried out within each of these categories and to measure the costs connected with the activities the standard thus presents a framework for recording and structuring costs once they have occurred in this paper we propose an approach for structuring the information on internal and external software failure costs such that their development over time can be represented by stochastic models based on these models future failure costs can be predicted in two case studies we show how the approach was applied in an industrial software development project 2009 ieee activity based costing continuous time markov chain cost prediction markov reward model software failure costs on the number of search queries required for internet plagiarism detection digital plagiarism detection tools have become an integral part of learning management systems in recent years discovering internet plagiarism in student papers has attracted a lot of attention from both researchers and software developers since the beginning of the www phenomena in this paper we discuss how the time performance of such search systems can be improved by reducing the number of search queries the study shows that if a significant part of a paper was plagiarized from the publically available on line sources then only a relatively small number of search queries are required to reliably locate the possible source for detailed comparison and manual confirmation of plagiarism indeed we show that a 5 selection is enough to find the source of plagiarized paper and using more than 40 of the text in the search queries does not improve the search results these findings help us to recommend the default search parameters for a plagiarism detection plug in for open source course management systems reduces the time required for querying the search engine thus decreasing the workload for the plagiarism detection system 2009 ieee the language and rhetoric of bibliographic citation in the field of computing a report of preliminary results this paper describes a preliminary investigation of bibliographic citation practices in the field of computing based on linguistic and rhetorical analyses of 1 255 citations in 36 academic papers from four representative journals in the field ieee transactions on software engineering ieee transactions on dependable and secure computing ieee transactions on parallel and distributed systems and the ieee transactions on computers rhetorical functions of the citations are identified along with representative examples of the language that is used to achieve the rhetorical goals the data is then discussed in light of current bibliographic citation instruction and recommendations are made for developing better training for novices and nonnative speakers of english who need more specific than is normally available 2009 ieee researching collaborative technologies in global virtual teams empirical studies from an interpretive perspective researching global software engineering teams gsets presents several phenomena of interest and raises several issues relating to choice of method given the important function of both time and space when studying gsets in field settings snapshot research methods such as the use of questionnaires and even interviews tend to fall short in capturing some of the innate complexities researchers from the information systems discipline have recommended the use of such research methods as qualitative case studies and action research but for software engineering researchers such methods appear uncommon action research in particular where the researcher is an active participant and even change agent challenges the notion of objective science this paper focuses on the design and conduct of empirical software engineering research from an interpretive viewpoint and demonstrates its application to theory development in field studies within global virtual team contexts the paper argues for a wider set of perspectives and an extension of the repertoire for researching the complex dynamic and essentially human phenomena represented by gsets 2009 ieee a metric based multi agent system for software project management software project management spm is one of the primary factors to software success or failure software projects often fail because the mangers do not know true project status software project planning can be one of the most critical activities in the spm process without a realistic and objective software

component identification approaches classification state of the art and comparison partitioning a design space to identify components with desired non functional and behavioral characteristics is a crucial task in the component based software development process accordingly the issue of how to analyze design models in order to systematically derive a set of components constitutes a research question which has been investigated repeatedly component identification approaches that have been published in literature however make use of different component definitions and identification strategies furthermore they vary from ad hoc findings and general recommendations to more formalized methods and techniques which aim at an optimized partitioning in this paper we elaborate on the state of the art in component identification and provide a classification of approaches that highlights their respective strengths and weaknesses to classify component identification approaches we introduce a classification scheme that contains important distinguishing factors it is used to compare existing approaches which have been compiled during a literature survey in addition it provides the basis to discuss significant differences between them and to identify remaining issues which give information about future research directions 2009 springer berlin heidelberg integrating usability engineering and software engineering in mixed reality system development the integration of user centred design activities into software engineering processes is a challenge this is especially true for next generation user interfaces that employ interface paradigms like mixed reality guidance for designers and developers has to address the integration of software engineering and user centred design on all levels from abstract standards to operational development we analyze standards in software engineering and usability engineering and derive recommendations for integrated development

interactions different flavours of recommendation systems have been proposed to help software developers perform software evolution tasks a number of these recommendation systems are based on changesets when changeset information is used recommendations are based on only the end result of the activity undertaken to complete a task in this paper we report on an investigation that compared how recommendations based on changesets compare to recommendations based on interactions collected as a programmer performed the task that resulted in a changeset to provide a common basis for the comparison our investigation considered how bug reports considered similar based on changeset information compare to bug reports considered similar based on interaction information we found that there is no direct relationship between the bug reports found similar with the different methods suggesting that each comparison methods captures a different aspect of the problem 2009 ieee challenges in the user interface design of an ide tool recommender to help software developers work efficiently integrated development environments ide include many tools all too often these developers are unaware of potentially useful tools within these ides that might help them complete their work more effectively to improve both awareness and use of tools within an ide we have been developing a recommendation system called spyglass that recommends tool s that might help a developer navigate information available in an ide more efficiently when designing such a recommendation system important considerations are both the content of the recommendations and the form and manner in which those recommendations are made in this paper we focus on what we learned about the form and manner of making tool recommendations from a longitudinal user study of spyglass these results may be useful to others designing various kinds of recommendation systems for ides 2009 ieee a score automatic software component recommendation using coding context reusing software components e g classes or modules improves software quality and developer s productivity unfortunately developers may miss many reusing opportunities since current keyword based component search systems cannot provide reusable components if the developers do not use them this paper proposes a new automatic component recommendation system which supports various usage scenarios and procedures for component reuse 2009 ieee static code analysis to detect software security vulnerabilities does experience matter code reviews with static analysis tools are today recommended by several security development processes developers are expected to use the tools output to detect the security threats they themselves have introduced in the source code this approach assumes that all developers can correctly identify a warning from a static analysis tool sat as a security threat that needs to be corrected we have conducted an industry experiment with a state of the art static analysis tool and real vulnerabilities we have found that average developers do not correctly identify the security warnings and only developers with specific experiences are better than chance in detecting the security vulnerabilities specific sat experience more than doubled the number of correct answers and a combination of security experience and sat experience almost tripled the number of correct security answers 2009 ieee the knowledge gap reduction in software engineering many papers proposed in the software engineering and information systems literature are dedicated to analysis of software projects missing their schedules exceeding their budgets delivering software products with poor quality and in some cases even wrong functionality the expression software crisis has been coined since the late 60 s to illustrate this phenomenon various solutions has been proposed by academics and practitioners in order to deal with the software crisis counter these trends and improve productivity and software quality such solutions recommend software process improvement as the best way to build software products needed by modern organizations among the well known solutions many are based either on software development tools or on software development approaches methods processes and notations nevertheless the scope of these solutions seems to be limited and the improvements they provide are often not significant we think that since software artifacts are accumulation of knowledge owned by organizational stakeholders the software crisis is due to a knowledge gap resulting from the discrepancy between the knowledge integrated in software systems and the knowledge owned by organizational actors in particular integrating knowledge management in software development process permits reducing the knowledge gap through building software products which reflect at least partly the organization s know how in this paper we propose a framework which provides a definition of knowledge based on information systems architecture and describes a knowledge oriented software development process to help organizations in reducing the software crisis impacts 2009 ieee business entity business function business process information knowledge organizational actor software process when user experience met agile a case study in mid

development perspective and how the user experience ux teams doing the design work would fit into that methodology was not clear as a result the ux teams faced many challenges and we have had to evolve our approach to how ux teams work with development scrum teams this case study details our ux teams experiences working with scrum for the past 18 months describing the challenges and issues that we faced and the solutions that we implemented to resolve those issues we recommend best practices for ux teams working in scrum particularly in a fast paced and large corporate environment we hope that others can avoid the common pitfalls that we faced in our initial adjustment to agile and scrum agile agile tips agile ucd design process research scrum technical writing ucd usability user experience ux mapo mining and recommending api usage patterns to improve software productivity when constructing new software systems programmers often reuse existing libraries or frameworks by invoking methods provided in their apis those api methods however are often complex and not well documented to get familiar with how those api methods are used programmers often exploit a source code search tool to search for code snippets that use the api methods of interest however the returned code snippets are often large in number and the huge number of snippets places a barrier for programmers to locate useful ones in order to help programmers overcome this barrier we have developed an api usage mining framework and its supporting tool called mapo mining api usage pattern from open source repositories for mining api usage patterns automatically a mined pattern describes that in a certain usage scenario some api methods are frequently called together and their usages follow some sequential rules mapo further recommends the mined api usage patterns and their associated code snippets upon programmers requests our experimental results show that with these patterns mapo helps programmers locate useful code snippets more effectively than two state of the art code search tools to investigate whether mapo can assist programmers in programming tasks we further conducted an empirical study the results show that using mapo programmers produce code with fewer bugs when facing relatively complex api usages comparing with using the two state of the art code search tools

fourier series in particular the methods recommended in iec standard 61000 4 7 and the methods applied in commercial power quality analyzers were investigated the analysis was carried out for a simulated signal and based on the real voltage registered in an isolated electric power system it consists of uncertainty evaluation and computational complexity assessment in the latter case a digital signal processor simulator and software developed by the author were used finally suggestions for constructors of future power quality analyzers were formulated 2009 ieee digital signal processors dsps fourier transforms measurement standards power quality spectral analysis current issues in teaching software modeling educators symposium at models 2008 software modeling is an increasingly popular method among software development teams to overcome the problems associated with complexity of contemporary software systems it can be argued that teaching modeling to software engineers is as important as teaching maths and physics to general engineers this lead many academic and industrial centers to introducing modeling courses to their curricula unfortunately it seems that education does not yet support the modeling paradigm well enough thus limiting its acceptance as a mature method of developing software systems this symposium sought for innovations on teaching modeling that would show its benefits in attractive and pedagogically e ective ways three areas that need improvement were identified placing modeling in the software engineering curriculum teaching model semantics and tool support for teaching modeling several pedagogical solutions in these three areas were presented the symposium concluded with several recommendations on such improvements with the most important being let the students play with models evaluating an agent oriented approach for change propagation a central problem in software maintenance is change propagation given a set of primary changes that have been made to software what additional secondary changes are needed although many approaches have been proposed automated change propagation is still a significant technical challenge in software engineering in this paper we report on an evaluation of an agent based approach for change propagation that works by repairing violations of well formedness consistency rules in a design model the results have shown that given a reasonable amount of primary changes the approach is able to assist the designer by recommending feasible secondary change options that match the designer s intentions techniques for software quality analysis of binaries applied to windows and linux 2009 acm in this paper we present our efforts to measure different quality aspects of large scale binary software we apply four well established metrics to binary versions of windows and debian linux analyze our results and discuss our observations it is surprising to see that our metrics which search for well known bad coding habits result with so many violations it appears that although bad and insecure software development practices are well understood and documented in practice recommended coding styles are not followed our work evaluates binary versions of software allowing us to inspect software quality without the need of source code we believe that this approach if successful could lead in the future to better priced software this is because the quality of software bought today is not transparent to its users binary analysis software quality static analysis analyses of task based learning in developing m learn mobile learning software solution case study developing mobile software solutions in order to enhance learning in university environments by using the new mobile communication technology is becoming a very popular research focus however there is a lack of research on the instruction method that should be used in the development of mobile

task based learning model the research focuses on the developed software solution and reviews learning modeling approach focusing on task based learning that from the findings is concluded as the best approach for mobile learning for testing purposes developed is a software prototype called m learn and its analyses has been investigated and recommendations for developing similar software solutions have been defined learning instructions m learning mobile software development task based learning formal modeling and verification of safety critical software rigorous quality demonstration is important when developing safety critical software such as a reactor protection system rps for a nuclear power plant although using formal methods such as formal modeling and verification is strongly recommended domain experts often reject formal methods for four reasons there are too many candidate techniques the notations appear complex the tools often work only in isolation and output is often too difficult for domain experts to understand a formal methods based process that supports development verification and validation and safety analysis can help domain experts overcome these obstacles nuclear engineers can also use case tools to apply formal methods without having to know details of the underlying formalism the authors spent more than seven years working with nuclear engineers in developing rps software and applying formal methods the engineers and regulatory personnel found the process effective and easy to apply with the integrated tool support 2009 ieee analytical models

communities currently five volumes exist or are in final stages of completion computer engineering computer science information systems information technology and software engineering as the field evolves these recommendations must evolve with new volumes produced as needed recently the computer science volume cc2001 was revised currently the information systems volume is undergoing revision and the information technology volume is nearing completion this session will highlight recent and ongoing changes in the computer science information systems and information technology curriculum volumes also to be discussed are future plans for curriculum recommendations the two major goals of this session are to inform the community and solicit feedback computer science education computing technology education curriculum information systems education information technology education guidelines for conducting and reporting case study research in software engineering case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context however the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies and hence the quality of the resulting studies this paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies the content is based on the authors own experience from conducting and reading case studies the terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains in particular social science and information systems and adapted to the needs in software engineering we present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research 2008 springer science business media llc case study checklists guidelines research methodology web

emerging with open environments the software paradigms such as open resource coalition and internetware present several novel characteristics including user centric non central control and continual evolution the goal of obtaining high confidence on such systems is more difficult to achieve the general developer oriented metrics and testing based methods which are adopted in the traditional measurement for high confidence software seem to be infeasible in the new situation firstly the software development is changed from the developer centric to user centric while user s opinions are usually subjective and cannot be generalized in one objective metric secondly there is non central control to guarantee the testing on components which formed the software system and continual evolution makes it impossible to test on the whole software system therefore this paper proposes a trust based approach that consists of three sequential sub stages 1 describing metrics for confidence estimation from users 2 estimating the confidence of the components based on the quantitative information from the trusted recommenders 3 estimating the confidence of the whole software system based on the component confidences and their interactions as well as attempts to make a step toward a reasonable and effective method for confidence estimation of the software system in open environments 2009 springer confidence internetware open resource coalition software architecture trust modeling processes of aose methodologies by means of a new editor this paper introduces a work in progress for definition of processes for aose methodologies fipa methodology technical committee encourages the definition of software engineering process models for multi agent systems methodologies and recommends the use of software process engineering metamodel spem defined by the object management group this paper follows those recommendations for obtaining a systematic method and an editor for describing software engineering process models for multiagent systems the editor has been built by means of the eclipse modeling framework and follows the spem standard several agent oriented processes have defined using the editor in addition the method for defining such processes is also addressed in this paper 2009 springer verlag berlin heidelberg development process ingenias metamodel multiagent systems mas spem tools bmr benchmarking metrics recommender for personnel issues in software development projects this paper presents an architecture which applies document similarity measures to the documentation produced during the phases of software development in order to generate recommendations of process and people metrics for similar projects the application makes a judgment of similarity of the service provision offer spo document of a new proposed project to a collection of project history documents phd stored in a repository of unstructured texts the process is carried out in three stages firstly clustering of the offer document with the set of phds which are most similar to it this provides the initial indication of whether similar previous projects exist and signifies similarity secondly determination of which phd in the set is most comparable with the offer document based on various parameters project effort project duration time project resources members size of team costs and sector s involved indicating comparability of projects the comparable parameters are extracted using the gate natural language processing architecture lastly a recommendation of metrics for the new project is made which is based on the transferability of the metrics of the most similar and comparable phd extracted here referred to as recommendation 2009 taylor francis group llc gate natural language processing ontologies semantics software metrics software operation time evaluation based on mtm many usability approaches have been devised to enable software developers to evaluate and improve user interfaces techniques have been focused on design recommendations not always supported by empirical evidences however in different environments based on internet web browser access software applications are the support for repetitive tasks in many cases supporting industrial or engineering processes e g hosted in intranets where operation time and learning curve are important items to be controlled in this paper a new method for measuring required operation time as basis for improving interaction and interface design is presented the basis of the method has been inspired on the adaptation of the well known mtm method for time measurement and task analysis in industrial environments empirical evidences support the relationship between the proposed measure and the time required for operations by software users 2008 elsevier ltd all rights reserved mtm operation time measurement software usability web browser a new methodology to automate the transformation of gis models in an iterative development process springer science business media llc 2009 in the majority of research today in areas such as evaluation of flood risks management of organic waste as it applies to plants and mapping ecological conditions of rivers scientific advances are often aimed toward the development of new software or the modification of existing software one of the particulars for software developed for agricultural or environmental fields is that this software manages geographic information the amount of geographic information has greatly increased over the past 20 years geographic information systems giss have been designed to store this information and use it to calculate indicators and to create maps to facilitate the presentation and the appropriation of the information often the development of these giss is a long and very hard process since the early 1970 s in order to help project managers software development processes have been designed and applied these development processes have also been used for gis developments in this chapter the authors present a new methodology to realize gis more easily and more interactively this methodology is based on model transformations a concept introduced by the object management group omg in its approach called model driven architecture mda when software is developed models are often used to improve the communication between users stakeholders and designers the changes of a model can be seen as a process where each action capture of user concepts modification of concepts removal of concepts etc transforms the model in the mda approach the omg recommends automation of these actions using model transformations the authors have developed a complete set of model transformations that enable one to ensure the evolution of a gis model from the analysis phase to the implementation phase integrating projects from multiple open source code forges much of the data about free libre and open source floss software development comes from studies of code forges or code repositories used for managing projects this paper presents a method for integrating data about open source projects by way of matching projects entities across multiple code forges after a review of the relevant literature a few of the methods are chosen and applied to the floss domain including a comparison of some simple scoring systems for pairwise project matches finally the paper describes limitations of this approach and recommendations for future work copyright 2009 igi global closed open systems data integration data mining database open source software software engineering linking software application development with the socio technical environment of stakeholders 2009 iadis there is a seemingly interminable debate amongst academics and practitioners as to exactly how successful information systems can be developed and whether that equates in any way with how they should be developed one school of thought prescribes a mechanistic approach with detailed methods and tools while others opine that such an approach is in no way grounded in real world experience and recommend a partial or fully amethodical line of attack the truth of course is that there is almost certainly no silver bullet no single right way to develop all information systems instead for each new project there is a unique conflagration of technology personnel time budget market social attitude and fashion to be faced by developers who themselves are equipped with different levels of experience and ability these related elements all bounded by a legal contractual system which finds it difficult to reflect the rapidly evolving nature of information systems development this paper outlines a framework developed from case study observations and indicates a potential direction for further research linking software development with the socio technical environment of stakeholders in the target organisation amethodical methodology systems development successful it implementation in facility management purpose the purpose of this research is a comparative analysis of computer

information technology it tools for mapping evaluation and control of facility management fm structures and processes despite the multitude of vendors and users in different branches there is still a lack of transparent and systematic case studies regarding successful cafm implementations and uncertainty about the market situation design methodology approach in the survey a systematic approach structured interviews was used allowing a comparison between cases in different application fields because of the geographical location of the project partners the entire german speaking area could be covered and thus the results of the analysis reflect the state of the art of cafm implementation and use in the german speaking area besides the case study the general market situation was investigated by interviewing relevant market players like associations end users consultants implementation partners and vendors findings this paper provides a comparative analysis of the cafm sectors in germany austria and switzerland it presents current trends technologies obstacles challenges and provides recommendations for a successful cafm implementation a systematic analysis of successful projects turned out to provide valuable assistance to both users and software developers resulting in an implementation model research limitations implications although in use for more than 15 years cafm still is a relatively new and challenging technological approach and thus by far not all projects can be considered a success the survey comprises about 20 cases both from the private and public sector it does not cover all application fields but the relevant sectors and market leading software implementations are considered in this way the survey is able to show typical strengths and weaknesses of current cafm projects practical implications the findings of the current survey provides valuable guidelines and assistance to fm organizations that start to implement cafm or need to improve the performance and outcome of their existing projects potential users are encouraged to implement their projects in a systematic manner by following the recommendations derived from the

germany switzerland quantifying system uncertainty of life cycle assessment based on monte carlo simulation background aim and scope many studies evaluate the results of applying different life cycle impact assessment lcia methods to the same life cycle inventory lci data and demonstrate that the assessment results would be different with different lica methods used although the importance of uncertainty is recognized most studies focus on individual stages of lca such as lci and normalization and weighting stages of lcia however an important question has not been answered in previous studies which part of the lca processes will lead to the primary uncertainty the understanding of the uncertainty contributions of each of the lca components will facilitate the improvement of the credibility of lca methodology a methodology is proposed to systematically analyze the uncertainties involved in the entire procedure of lca the monte carlo simulation is used to analyze the uncertainties associated with lci lcia and the normalization and weighting processes five lcia methods are considered in this study i e eco indicator 99 edip eps impact 2002 and lime the uncertainty of the environmental performance for individual impact categories e g global warming ecotoxicity acidification eutrophication photochemical smog human health is also calculated and compared the lca of municipal solid waste management strategies in taiwan is used as a case study to illustrate the proposed methodology results the primary uncertainty source in the case study is the lci stage under a given lcia method in comparison with various lcia methods edip has the highest uncertainty and eco indicator 99 the lowest uncertainty setting aside the uncertainty caused by lci the weighting step has higher uncertainty than the normalization step when eco indicator 99 is used comparing the uncertainty of various impact categories the lowest is global warming followed by eutrophication ecotoxicity human health and photochemical smog have higher uncertainty discussion in this case study of municipal waste management it is confirmed that different lcia methods would generate different assessment results in other words selection of lcia methods is an important source of uncertainty in this study the impacts of human health ecotoxicity and photochemical smog can vary a lot when the uncertainties of lci and lcia procedures are considered for the purpose of reducing the errors of impact estimation because of geographic differences it is important to determine whether and which modifications of assessment of impact categories based on local conditions are necessary conclusions this study develops a methodology of systematically evaluating the uncertainties involved in the entire lca procedure to identify the contributions of different assessment stages to the overall uncertainty which modifications of the assessment of impact categories are needed can be determined based on the comparison of uncertainty of impact categories recommendations and perspectives such an assessment of the system uncertainty of lca will facilitate the improvement of lca if the main source of uncertainty is the lci stage the researchers should focus on the data quality of the lci data if the primary source of uncertainty is the lcia stage direct application of lcia to non lcia software developing nations should be avoided 2008 springer verlag life cycle impact assessment lcia life cycle inventory lci municipal solid waste management quantification of uncertainty system

buildings can contribute to significant energy savings and improve the students learning environment the purpose of this research is to formulate design recommendations for school buildings in the hot humid climatic zone and assess the influence of different design variables on their energy consumption a base case classroom was constructed by taking commonly used values for each design variable using computer simulation techniques these variables were modified one by one to find the value that minimized energy consumption while keeping thermal and visual comfort in the room based on these tests the recommended value for each design variable to achieve a high performance classroom was determined comparative tests were done to determine which variables have greatest impact on the energy consumption and thermal comfort in the classroom and how their absolute influence depends on the order of implementation of each improvement a complex interdependence among the design variables was

maintain large multi threaded software systems however the maintenance of such systems is typically not well covered by software engineering texts or curricula we conducted a think aloud study with 15 students in a graduate level computer science class to discover the strategies that students apply and to what effect in performing corrective maintenance on concurrent software we collected think aloud and action protocols and annotated the protocols for a number of behavioral attributes and maintenance strategies we divided the protocols into groups based on the success of the participant in both diagnosing and correcting the failure we evaluated these groups for statistically significant differences in these attributes and strategies in this paper we report a number of interesting observations that came from this study all participants performed diagnostic executions of the program to aid program comprehension however the participants that used this as their predominant strategy for diagnosing the fault were all unsuccessful among the participants that successfully diagnosed the fault and displayed high confidence in their diagnosis we found two commonalities they all recognized that the fault involved the violation of a concurrent programming idiom and they all constructed detailed behavioral models similar to uml sequence diagrams of execution scenarios we present detailed analyses to explain the attributes that correlated with success or lack of success based on these analyses we make recommendations for improving software engineering curriculums by

site customer to represents their requirements through user stories on story cards generally customers have rarely a general picture of the requirements or system in their mind which leads problems related to requirements like requirements conflicts missing requirements and ambiguous requirements etc and not address non functional requirements from exploration phase two third of the projects are failed because of ambiguous and incomplete user requirements and poor quality of the requirements acceptance testing is also one of the key issues which is often left unsolved or uncovered to verify user requirements in xp agile software development methodology to solve these problems we propose a new improved requirement elicitation gathering process framework for story cards in xp to improve quality of user stories to capture functional and non functional user requirements on story cards our approach involves adopting acceptance tests right from story cards as soon as requirements are

negotiation to produce requirement specification in many cases it is risky or very difficult and not economical to produce a complete verifiable set of requirements traditional software development has a problem to deal with requirement change after careful analysis and negotiation this problem is well tackled by the xp as xp recommends an on site customer to represents their requirements

story knowledge based system development with scripting technology a recommender system example the core functionality of many knowledge based systems is built with the help of special purpose software components and programming environments such as rule engines or prolog interpreters other parts of the application like the web interface are however built with standard software development technology like java which means that not only the corresponding interfaces and data exchange mechanisms between the components have to be developed but also that the software developers have to work with different technologies or even programming paradigms in this paper we show how recent scripting extensions in a programming language like java can be exploited to develop highly flexible and extensible knowledge intensive applications the different advantages of such an approach are discussed based on the experiences gained from developing a scripting based software library for building

dimensions of tools for detecting software conflicts previous work has found that the number of defects in a source file is proportional to the number of developers who concurrently access the file several conflict recommender tools have been proposed that can aid programmers in detecting conflicts that lead to such defects these can be classified according to several design dimensions including how early in the programming process the potential conflict is identified which if any of existing software systems must be extended to create the tool the granularity of the program constructs that are identified as conflicting the criteria used for identifying conflicts how the conflict information is obtained and whether the tool supports individual or collaborative inspection of the conflict the various points defined by this design space can be analyzed according to several evaluation dimensions including the number of false positives and negatives given by the tool how much effort is required to find fix the conflict the computation and communication costs of the tool how much change it requires to the current software development process how much screen real estate is used by the tool during coding and to what extent is the privacy of programmers invaded the identification and analysis of these design and evaluation dimensions can lead to better evaluation of the various aspects of existing tools and an integrated tool that combines orthogonal features of different tools copyright 2008 acm awareness collaborative software development configuration management

applications seven habits of a highly effective smell detector towards an agent based framework for guiding design exploration improving the readability of defect reports and a recommendation system for security requirements understanding the context of design towards tactical user centered design it is widely recognized that system usability requires active involvement of end users in all phases of software development and there is currently a broad consensus among researchers and practitioners in the field as to what constitutes a good usercentered design process despite this many systems development projects still fail when it comes to addressing usability issues and appropriately involving users in the design process we find that a project s boundary conditions are becoming increasingly important for the potential impact of user centered design activities and hence the success of the end result of the project we propose and define context of design as a concept to embrace the socio technical system in which user centered design takes place the context of design includes but is not limited to the internal structure of the developer and the client organizations contractual and tender issues software engineering tools and stakeholder agendas and relations we illustrate the reasoning with various cases in which user centered design has been constrained by factors in the context of design we recommend that user centered design projects give priority to an early identification of factors in the context of design that pose risks to end product usability by analyzing the context of design for each project we may be able to better tailor user centered design activities to reach the goal of building a more usable end result copyright 2008 acm context of design obstacles usability user centered design a taxonomy of homeland security modeling simulation and analysis applications the effective use of modeling simulation and analysis msa applications could greatly enhance our nation s ability to achieve homeland security goals these applications can be used to evaluate vulnerabilities in the nation s critical infrastructure as well as engineer security systems to respond to those vulnerabilities they can also be used to train participants in the national incident management system and assess their performance plan operations such as responses to terrorist attacks and natural disasters and support decision making processes within homeland security agencies currently the development of msa tools has been conducted largely on an ad hoc and piecemeal basis there is very little if any coordination of msa development activities across government agencies the research community the commercial software sector and various standards organizations without coordination and appropriate standards there is little possibility of software re use or the establishment of reference data sets that meet homeland security needs this report describes a taxonomy or classification system of msa application areas that are critical to meeting homeland security needs the taxonomy will be used to classify applications and develop requirements analyses for those applications these analyses will in turn be used to identify a recommended suite of existing standards and standards gaps that must be filled with these standards recommendations agency program managers software developers and standards development organizations can work together to resolve interoperability issues between msa software applications and achieve better re use of software and data sets and standards classification homeland security interoperability simulation taxonomy end user development approaches towards a flexible software design acknowledging the competition in today s global markets demands enterprises to be resilient in order to survive therefore product life cycles shorten and new customer segments have to be addressed permanently obviously such environments require flexible information systems which can be adapted quickly to the enterprises changing needs without spending vast amounts of resources using end user development eud approaches can help to solve this dilemma by enabling software developers to create information systems that can even be adapted by technically inexperienced end users this reduces time and costs needed for adaptations and increases their quality by avoiding potential misunderstandings between business users and it experts this paper presents a broad overview of existing eud approaches based on this it provides recommendations how eud design principles can be used conjointly to develop embedded design environments for end users we describe and classify eud approaches taken from the literature which are suitable approaches for different groups of end users implementing the right mixture of eud approaches leads to embedded design environments having a gentle slope of complexity such environments enable differently skilled end users to perform system adaptations on their own adaptable software design approaches design recommendations end user development methods and methodologies a comparison of evaluation networks and collaboration networks in open source software communities the open source software oss development communities have experienced rapid growth in recent years previous social network studies on oss communities focused on collaboration relationships however information about how oss community members perceive each other is largely ignored in this study we report an empirical investigation of the evaluation network in an online oss community which includes over 11 800 oss projects and more than 94 330 developers a collaboration network is modeled from this data set and analyzed for comparison purposes we find the evaluation network is significantly different from collaboration network in average degree average path length and fragmentation rate furthermore we argue that the evaluation networks can be used to locate expertise skillful developers in oss communities and capture important social relationships among the developers missed in the collaboration network these characteristics of the evaluation network may benefit the research of oss development communities and expert recommendation systems community

the matrix model of computation mmc is a new turing complete virtual machine that serves as a formal container for the structural representation and analysis of systems and can be applied in diverse areas such as business software engineering theoretical physics and neuroscience the mmc is a unifying notion in systemics it allows uniform interoperable techniques to be applied to systems in general using a uniform machine interpretable representation that is amenable to formal mathematical manipulation in this paper we show the mmc equivalence with deutsch s universal quantum computer argue that every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly represented by an mmc model and propose the mmc as a universal model of computation we introduce the canonical form of the mmc and present two scope constriction algorithms for module clustering the algorithms refactor the model to reconcile the flow of data with the flow of control and create objects by partitioning the mmc

classification based on association which combines concepts from classification and association in this way association rules perform a predictive role these techniques not very extended have not been applied in the recommender systems area in order to provide recommendations more effectively in this work we suggest that associative classifiers can be also used in these type of systems therefore a revision about the recommender systems and the methods of associative classification is presented in addition a case study is described in which traditional and associative classifiers are evaluated and compared using data from recommender systems the results showed that both type of classifiers can be applied effectively in such systems nevertheless punctual characteristics on data determine

engines hddes support critical and high cost services thus failure of such engines can have serious economic and health impacts it is necessary that diagnosis is done during both preventive

computerized tools for diagnosing hddes are tied to particular manufacturer s products in addition most of them do not have the functionality that is required to assist inexperienced technicians to completely diagnose and repair hdde faults because most of the tools have only the capability to identify hdde faults these tools are not able to recommend corrective action this paper presents an easy to use expert system for diagnosing hdde faults that is based on the bayesian network technology using bayesian networks simplified the modeling of the complex process of diagnosing hddes

developing applications using object oriented paradigm identification of types of objects from the requirements is the primary goal of every ooa most commonly recommended approach to identify objects is to search for nouns directly from the requirements or indirectly from the use cases derived from requirements experience has shown that both these approaches are inefficient in their own ways in this paper we have proposed a new approach of capturing object oriented requirements based on analysis of events and actions occurring in the system and then identify all static and dynamic components of the system from it our approach captures requirements in the form of event patterns that are templates in our event oriented approach analogous to use cases in the conventional object orientation these templates are used in finding out object oriented components of the system during the process of ooa we have also proposed an event meta model that forms the basis of our event based class

how of process simulation this paper aims to assess how spsm has evolved during the past 10 years in particular whether the reasons for spsm the simulation paradigms tools problem domains and model scopes have changed we performed a systematic literature review of software process simulation papers from the prosim series1 publications in the last decade we identified 96 studies from the sources and included them in this review the papers were categorized into four major types and data needed to address each research question was extracted we found a need for refining the reasons and the classification scheme for spsm introduced by kmr more emerging spsm paradigms and model scopes were added to enhance kmr s discussion trends over time showed that interest in continuous modeling was decreasing and interest in micro processes was increasing hybrid models were based primarily on system dynamics and discrete event simulation and were all implemented by vertical integration we recommend spsm research concentrate more on recent software processes and on making spsm more reusable and thus easier to build work in progress measuring reading comprehension in technical courses reading is critical to any course however many courses in higher education especially technical courses do not emphasize reading as a significant part of the course despite recommendations from

of adaptive book an interactive software tool that allows students to annotate and label the text and an online markup analysis tool that uses a heuristic rule based algorithm to compare student

software quality engineers to introduce project specific cost of module misclassification into model evaluation classifying a software module as fault prone implies the application of some verification activities thus adding to the development cost misclassifying a module as fault free carries the risk of system failure also associated with cost implications through the analysis of sixteen projects from public repositories we observe that software quality does not necessarily benefit from the prediction of fault prone components the inclusion of misclassification cost in model evaluation may indicate that even the best models achieve performance no better than trivial classification our results support a recommendation to adopt cost curves as one of the standard methods for software quality model performance evaluation 2008 ieee improving admission control policies in database management systems using data mining techniques increasing workload on multi user database management system dbms can cause maximum system s throughput with further increase of workload throughput dramatically decreases and system performance fall down then system starts to thrash existence of an admission control component for managing user s requests is necessary admission control component in dbms has two main tasks these tasks are prevention of increasing user s communication requests to system more than a threshold and prevention deferment or execution of received requests after optimization step and determination of request requirements the problem is determination of allowable number of communications to dbms can we predict and determine conditions to providence time and resource before reach to optimization step in this paper we use data mining techniques to predict and describe admission control policies according to this purpose we recommend an admission logging system to log existing actions before end of query processor procedures we describe situation structure and changes that we need in system then we describe the circumstance of knowledge extraction on admission log 2008 ieee admission control data mining dbms policy cooperative recommendation based on ontology construction in the traditional information service system the lack of service personalization and semantic information influences the intelligence of information service and decreases the quality of service cooperative recommendation has emerged as an effective technology for personalized information access in this paper we present a framework of cooperative recommendation based on ontology construction we first construct domain ontology and find user interest through user behavior record database then construct user interest ontology by the mapping relationship between user interest and domain ontology through identifying the vertical weight by user interest similarity the horizontal weight by the level of ontology concept utilize counted by pagerank we use the improved weighted association rule algorithm to mining the concepts in user interest ontology and exploit the user interest model at last we realize the semantic based personalized

regression testing is used to achieve adequate confidence in changed software to achieve confidence currently organizations re execute the entire system test suite on the entire software reexecuting entire system test suite is an expensive and time consuming activity to reduce such costs execution of smaller regression test suite to validate the changed software is suggested several techniques both code based and model based that recommend smaller regression test suites have been proposed in the literature largely the model based regression test selection techniques are based on design models in this paper we propose a regression test suite selection approach based on commonly used requirement analysis model uml use case activity diagram as a part of the approach we also propose a concept called behavioral slicing to structure activity diagrams based on the proposed approach a prototype tool has been designed and developed using the prototype we have conducted real world case studies and observed impressive productivity and quality gains using agent to coordinate web services traditionally agent and web service are two separate research areas we figure that through agent communication agent is suitable to coordinate web services however there exist agent communication problems due to the lack ofuniform cross platform vocabulary fortunately ontology defines a vocabulary we thus present the web ontology language owl based operational ontology that defines a declarative description which can be accessed by various engines to facilitate agent communication and we define mental attitude of agent to be shared among agents our architecture enhanced the 3apl agent platform and it is implemented as an agent communication framework finally we extended the framework to be compatible with the web ontology language for service owl s and then develop a movie recommendation system with four owl s semantic web services on the framework the benefits of this work are 1 dynamic web service coordination 2 ontological reasoning through uniform representation namely the declarative description and 3 easy reuse and extension ofboth ontology and engine through extending ontology agent communication agent mentality layer semantic web service quality model for the selection of floss based issue tracking system the complexity of the issue tracking systems its

engineering is becoming increasingly popular in software development projects as it raises level of abstraction thus improving our ability to handle complex systems in many academic and industrial centers software modeling has already been introduced into their curricula despite this it seems that education does not yet support the modeling paradigm well enough thus limiting its acceptance as a mature method of developing software systems the goal of this symposium was to find ways to change this situation specifically the symposium sought ways of showing benefits of modeling in a way that is pedagogically effective and attractive to the students it also tried to make recommendations for placing the modeling courses in the overall software development educational path which should include not only uml fundamentals but also a demonstration of the importance and place of modeling in the overall path from business environment to software products 2008 springer verlag berlin

kinds of software systems among which we can find intelligent virtual environments for training the agent community has already started to pay attention to software engineering issues to develop agent oriented systems but they are mainly focused on methodologies and to some extent design patterns however not much attention has been paid to software architecture for the moment we compare two agent based software architectures for intelligent virtual environments for training that are intended to be easily extended and modified the first one was designed using an organizational approach recommended by some agent oriented methodologies the second one is a redesign of the first architecture using more formal principles and methods of software architecture design a comparison between both architectures highlights the need to pay more attention to software architecture design in this field 2008 springer verlag berlin heidelberg a recommender system architecture for instructional

the effects of change control and management review on software flexibility and project performance software flexibility and project efficiency are deemed to be desirable but conflicting goals during software development we considered the link between project performance software flexibility and management interventions specially we examined software flexibility as a mediator between two recommended management control mechanisms management review and change control and project performance the model was empirically evaluated using data collected from 212 project managers in the project management institute our results confirmed that the level of control activities during the system development process was a significant facilitator of software flexibility which in turn enhanced project success a mediator role of software flexibility implied that higher levels of management controls could achieve higher levels of software flexibility and that this was beneficial not only to the maintainability of complex applications but also to project performance 2008 change control management review project management software flexibility software process improvement increasing the

investigation knowledge for code understanding software maintenance tasks typically involve an important amount of program investigation effort on the part of software developers to what extent can we benefit from prior program investigation activities to decrease this effort to investigate this question we studied the revision history of two systems to determine how knowledge derived from prior investigation activities could have been reused to support other change tasks our initial investigation used a tool concerndetector that can recommend sets of program elements associated with a high level concern when elements in the set overlap with elements currently being modified we discovered that simple overlap based techniques for retrieving prior investigation knowledge have important limitations and that effective reuse of prior program investigation biowledge requires analyses that can partially infer the nature and intent of a task 2008 ieee miflowcyt the minimum information

together to work on global software development projects this paper reports on our experiences and lessons from spring 2007 when the focus was on these students working together on the development of a single software system one key objective was to investigate how to create a shared and open source tooling environment to support a distributed development process that has evolved over two years the setting is unique in that it seeks to accommodate students from a mix of established developing and emerging countries who as a consequence have had varying levels of exposure to the internet and use it in non similar ways the findings lessons and recommendations from our study are reported in this paper not surprisingly when the perceived professional value of assumed everyday technologies is dissimilar across cultures preparation for the communications tooling needs more attention than the engineering tooling this has important implications for the emphasis placed on process and soft skills in the respective classrooms and highlights some challenges facing emerging countries as they strive to become players in the global workforce 2008 ieee code conjurer pulling reusable software

artifact throughout the various phases of software development it can be used to identify the impact of changes when changes are performed to the system masce a multi agent system for collaborative e learning e learning has become one of the most popular teaching methods in recent years one of its modes is the blended learning where learners can read teaching materials asynchronously from a teaching website and collaborate with their peers while providing for necessary face to face explanation discussion and physical operation in the classroom in the computational intelligence field the intelligent agent paradigm gained a tremendous interest in many application domains over the last two decades 1 2 this research project paper focuses on the use of intelligent agents in the sphere of e learning education with the help of collaborative learning 3 intelligent agents the so called e assistants or helper programs can sit inside a computer and make the learning in e learning happen dynamically to suit the need of the user they can trap the user s likes and dislikes in various areas the level of knowledge and the learning style and accordingly recommend the best matching helpers for collaboration the paper introduces a multi agent system for collaborative e learning masce masce is to assist teaching and learning process and also to encourage collaborative learning among peers this system shall be used in a blended learning environment as a supplement to the face to face lecture where students can use the system in the lab or from home after attending the traditional lecture in the faculty the objective is to incorporate the intelligence of the multi agent system mas in a way that enables it to actively and intelligently support the educational processes where multiple agents can interact to exchange information so that students may collaborate on how best to gain knowledge the proposed mas system considers two types of users namely students and instructors each of these users has a corresponding agent these are student agent and instructor agent the student agent runs on the student s computer thus each student is equipped with a student agent which helps the learning process of the student it manages the student s personal profile and also tracks the student actions during learning process and updates his profile accordingly on the other hand the instructor agent provides teaching materials assesses the progress and participation of different students through quizzes and manages the progress of the course the innovation in the proposed system is the introduction of the assistant agent which is initialized as soon as any of the users starts to use the system the assistant agent runs on the system s server it plays a centric role in the proposed system the assistant agent has a collaboration mechanism which will be used for match making and community building to help increase collaboration between peers it shall also give hints to the instructor to help in the teaching process such as statistics of the results of quizzes and summaries of students profiles to help in the final grading it acts a mediator between student agents and instructor agent after receiving the preferences goals of the instructor and the students it will run autonomously and self dependently thus the proposed mas consists of three types of agents the course material is going to be structured in a hierarchical form where the course is divided into chapters and each chapter is divided into sections which in turn are divided into subsections and so on until we reach the leaves concepts which cannot be divided any further for each of these leaves the following will be provided 1 teaching materials 2 quizzes to test student s knowledge level 3 students notes blogs 4 discussion forums 5 questions asked by students requiring help the student can review all the teaching materials provided and add notes to his blogs if he wants to he will take quizzes after each module to test his understanding knowledge level in that part so as to update his profile if the student asks a question in a particular section the assistant agent match maker will try to find the best potential helper for that question who is currently available online willing and able to provide help the assistant agent uses the students models in that match making process some of the parameters which are going to be used to in the model are static they are collected from the student himself through a questionnaire given to the student when he first uses the system including 1 help willingness 2 initial availability 3 preferences such as cognitive style maximum numbers of concurrent discussions 4 initial belief of the student knowledge level through a simple quiz given to the student to classify him as either novice beginner intermediate or advanced 5 weighted importance of various attributes such as if he requires help quickly from any available willing helper or he would rather wait to be matched with the helper with the best knowledge level in the concept he is asking about some of these parameters are dynamic they are updated dynamically as the student interacts with the system and more new information is collected old information may be outdated or even wrong for example after each help session between two students an evaluation form is presented to each of them to evaluate his colleague these peer evaluations along with the collected information about student by the tracking system such as rate of his responses are all used to update the helpfulness parameter the actions parameters that the tracking system will monitor and that will be collected modeled and analyzed are 1 actual availability 2 frequency of logging to the system number of times in one week period for example 3 banned topics or users 4 preferred users 5 quizzes taken to update student s knowledge level 6 downloaded teaching materials 7 blogs visited and notes added by the student to his blog 8 number of postings on the forums 9 frequency and type of questions asked to instructor or peers not content based 10 number of help requests accepted or rejected 11 peer evaluation for finding best potential helper the match maker assistant agent in our system first searches for those users online and who have not reached the maximum of their concurrent discussions online and who are helpful and have good knowledge level of the concept asked about the multi agent system for collaborative e learning masce shall be installed on the lab that is equipped with 25 state of the art pcs the following servers are used to allow collaboration microsoft sharepoint server microsoft exchange server microsoft live communication server active directory server and microsoft sql server the lab is connected as an intranet the access to the internet extends the benefits of the system outside the lab the complete mas system will provide functionalities essential in the educational process such as real time as well as offline data and information gathering analysis and distribution embedded feedback assessment and collaboration the complete system analysis is going to be the main part of a ph d work the first phase of this complete system will consider mainly the development of the basic functionality of the student and instructor agents and focus on the building and complete functionality of the assistant agent the analysis and design phase of masce is done using beliefs desires intentions agent based software development bdi aspd we find desires first from the system requirements and then find its intention and corresponding belief this idea comes from the natural approach we usually do in the real world an agent s beliefs are a set of data describing the state of the environment they are the knowledge that intentions use to fulfill their goals desires 2008 ieee design methodology for developing concept independent rotorcraft analysis and design software many comprehensive rotorcraft performance analysis tools have been developed to assist engineers during the preliminary and detailed phases of rotorcraft design however most of these tools are not appropriate for conceptual design because they are either too concept specific or too cumbersome for sizing and comparing the performance of vastly different concepts in a timely manner a need exists to develop software tools which are capable of quickly sizing various concepts i e single main rotor helicopter coaxial rotor helicopter tilt rotor etc in order to assist engineers in selecting the best concept to satisfy a set of mission requirements as an illustration the concept independent rotorcraft analysis and design software cirads developed at georgia institute of technology is presented to demonstrate the applicability of such software tools cirads is a modular object oriented software application with a graphical user interface gui developed using the java programming language and optimization algorithms developed in matlab but compiled as a stand alone windows executable the gui is used to define mission and sizing requirements aircraft configurations engines and airfoils which are saved as separate transferable object files for use in analysis or design simulations performance parameters are calculated using a modified momentum theory based model developed using a generic rotorcraft concept with arbitrary rotor nacelle angle and optional wings auxiliary propulsion and anti torque additional provisions for combined blade element momentum theory cbem based performance models have been planned and partially developed for future integration iterative ratio of fuel rf sizing and optimization algorithms are used to determine the minimum gross weight for a given configuration based on the mission requirements and rotorcraft component parameters advanced design features accommodate the sizing and analysis of innovative concepts such as coaxial mono tilt rotors boxed wing tail sitters and aircraft with dynamically morphing rotor diameters and airfoil properties through the development of cirads and its predecessors three recommended objectives have been established for developing future software tools the software should 1 have a broad capability of quickly modeling various rotorcraft concepts with different mission requirements 2 have a very intuitive graphical user interface that allows users of different backgrounds and experience levels to use it without extensive formal training and 3 allow users to specify different levels of component detail and different calculation methods with varying degrees of accuracy and processing time to support multiple phases of design cirads has proven to be very effective in assisting rotorcraft design teams at georgia tech during the ahs student design competitions and will potentially be a model for developing

unsafe code escaping into production devices three prominent rule sets comprising 345 unique rules are studied each rule is classified by its rationale techniques for detecting violations of the rules are discussed and each of the rules is further classified by the technology best suited for its enforcement many rules are found to be ambiguous or prone to subjective interpretations this is a particular problem for automatic enforcement as tools require a precise specification for some classes of rules theoretical and technological limitations mean that tools may report violations where no such violations occur strategies for managing these false positives are discussed broad recommendations for adoption and enforcement of rules are given 2008 ieee recommending software artifacts from repository transactions the central problem addressed by this interdisciplinary paper is to predict related software artifacts that are usually changed together by a developer the working focus of programmers is revealed by means of their interactions with a software repository that receives a set of cohesive artifact changes within one commit transaction this implicit knowledge of interdependent changes can be exploited in order to recommend likely further changes given a set of already changed artifacts we suggest a hybrid approach based on latent semantic indexing lsi and machine learning methods to recommend software development artifacts that is predicting a sequence of configuration items that were committed together as opposed to related approaches to repository mining that are mostly based on symbolic methods like association rule mining arm our connectionist method is able to generalize onto unseen artifacts text analysis methods are employed to consider their textual attributes we applied our technique to three publicly available datasets from the promise repository of software engineering databases the evaluation showed that the connectionist lsi approach achieves a significantly higher recommendation accuracy than existing methods based on arm even when generalizing onto unseen artifacts our approach still provides an accuracy of up to 72 7

engineering results using structured abstracts a randomised experiment when conducting a systematic literature review researchers usually determine the relevance of primary studies on the basis of the title and abstract however experience indicates that the abstracts for many software engineering papers are of too poor a quality to be used for this purpose a solution adopted in other domains is to employ structured abstracts to improve the quality of information provided this study consists of a formal experiment to investigate whether structured abstracts are more complete and easier to understand than non structured abstracts for papers that describe software engineering experiments we constructed structured versions of the abstracts for a random selection of 25 papers describing software engineering experiments the 64 participants were each presented with one abstract in its original unstructured form and one in a structured form and for each one were asked to assess its clarity measured on a scale of 1 to 10 and completeness measured with a questionnaire that used 18 items based on a regression analysis that adjusted for participant abstract type of abstract seen

preferred conventional abstracts many conventional software engineering abstracts omit important information our study is consistent with studies from other disciplines and confirms that structured abstracts can improve both information content and readability although care must be taken to develop appropriate structures for different types of article we recommend that software engineering

for multidisciplinary study of free open source software development the free open source software f oss research community is growing across and within multiple disciplines this community faces a new and unusual situation the traditional difficulties of gathering enough empirical data have been replaced by issues of dealing with enormous amounts of freely available public data from many disparate sources online discussion forums source code directories bug reports oss web portals etc consequently these data are being discovered gathered analyzed and used to support multidisciplinary research however at present no means exist for assembling these data under common access points and frameworks for comparative longitudinal and collaborative research across disciplines gathering and maintaining large f oss data collections reliably and making them usable present several research challenges for example current projects usually rely on direct access to and mining of raw data from groups that generate it and both of these methods require unique effort for each new corpus or even for updating existing corpora in this paper we identify several needs and critical factors in f oss empirical research across disciplines and suggest recommendations for design of a global research infrastructure for multi disciplinary research into f oss development 2008 international federation for information processing update propagation practices in highly reusable open source components in today s business and software arena more and more companies are adopting open source software an example of this rising phenomenon is to base software products on highly reusable open source components in this scenario the evolution of the software product is coupled with the evolution of the open source component a common assumption is that component updates are immediately and regularly propagated to the project this paper investigates this assumption empirically by studying update propagation practices in two popular open source libraries zlib and ffmpeg for each library we analyze various repository sources with information such as bug reports revision history and source code the results of the case studies suggest that update propagation is subject to several technical and non technical factors including the way the open source library is used the extent to which updates are documented and the degree of community involvement based on these findings we propose a set of recommendations that would allow better follow up of updates and smoother update propagation 2008 international federation for information processing domain specific model editors with model completion today integrated development environments such as eclipse allow users to write programs quickly by presenting a set of recommendations for code completion similarly word processing tools such as microsoft word present corrections for grammatical errors in sentences both of these existing systems use a set of constraints expressed in the form of a grammar to restrict correct the user taking this idea further in this paper we present an integrated software system capable of generating recommendations for model completion of partial models built in arbitrary domain specific model editors we synthesize the model editor equipped with automatic completion from a modelling language s declarative specification consisting of a meta model and constraints on it along with a visual syntax the automatic completion feature is powered by a prolog engine whose input is a constraint logic program derived from some models the input logic program is obtained by a model transformation from models in multiple languages the meta model as a class diagram constraints on it as constraint logic clauses and a partial model in the domain specific language the prolog engine solves the generated logic program and the solution if there is one is returned to the model editor as a set of recommendations for properties of the partial model we incorporate automatic completion in the generative tool atom 3 and use swi prolog for constraint representation and satisfaction we present examples using an illustrative visual language of finite state machines 2008 springer verlag berlin heidelberg the software invention cube a classification scheme for software inventions the patent system protects inventions the requirement that a software invention should make a technical contribution turns out to be untenable in practice and this raises the question what constitutes an invention in the realm of software the authors developed the software invention cube swic a classification of software inventions and used this classification to explore the meaning of the notions novelty inventive step and someone skilled in the art for software inventions they came to the conclusion that no meaningful distinction can be made between software invention and software discovery which is crucial in patent law they also showed that only in very few cases copyright is an alternative for patents to protect software inventions in their analysis they made a distinction between software inventionism the point of view that software inventions per se can exist and precede any patenting or any other form of protection and the techno political decisions that can be combined with it the result is a framework that enables reasoning about the software inventions and their potential protection hence the question of what constitutes a software invention and the desirability to protect such an invention in any way is completely decoupled this paper is a sequel to the previous paper 1 in which a proposal was formulated for an ipr based software engineering life cycle and it was argued that only when an ipr based software engineering life cycle is used a rational strategy towards software patenting software patent licensing as well as ipr defense is possible further an extensive discussion was given regarding the problem of so called trivial patents these seem to undermine the vitality and usefulness of the software patenting system a number of examples of patents and patent applications that may be considered trivial were given long term strategies were discussed to remove trivial patents from the scene further a research agenda consisting of a number of promising research questions concerning software patenting was worked out in significant detail and several policy recommendations were made ipr on software software engineering lifecycle software inventions software patents a multi agent legal recommender system infonorma is a multi agent system that provides its users with recommendations of legal normative instruments they might be interested in the filter agent of infonorma classifies normative instruments represented as semantic web documents into legal branches and performs content based similarity analysis this agent as well as the entire infonorma system was modeled under the guidelines of maaem a software development methodology for multi agent application engineering this article describes the infonorma requirements specification the architectural design solution for those requirements the detailed design of the filter agent and the implementation model of infonorma according to the guidelines of the maaem methodology 2008 springer science business media b v content based filtering legal information systems multi agent systems ontologies recommender systems semantic web quality and reliability in software engineering after introducing relevant software quality attributes and measures to be taken in order to increase software reliability this contribution recommends the extensive application of structural testing strategies for this purpose it provides automatic support by two novel tools based on multi criterial heuristics and capable of maximizing test coverage by a minimum number of automatically generated test cases with corresponding test data thus they provide assistance to different test phases component integration system testing in an automatic and cost efficient way successively the article focuses on the quantitative estimation of software reliability illustrates the limits of existing approaches and recommends to overcome them by making use of operational experience gained with reusable software carl hanser verlag teaching disciplined software development discipline is an essential prerequisite for the development of large and complex software intensive systems however discipline is also important on the level of individual development activities a major challenge for teaching disciplined software development is to enable students to experience the benefits of discipline and to overcome the gap between real professional scenarios and scenarios used in software engineering university courses students often do not have the chance to internalize what disciplined software development means at both the individual and collaborative level therefore students often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of disciplined development and later on tend to avoid applying the underlying principles the personal software process psp and the team software process tsp are tools designed to help software engineers control manage and improve the way they work at both the individual and collaborative level both tools have been considered effective means for introducing discipline into the conscience of professional developers in this paper we address the meaning of disciplined software development its benefits and the challenges of teaching it we present a quantitative study that demonstrates the benefits of disciplined software development on the individual level and provides further experience and recommendations with psp and tsp as teaching tools 2007 elsevier inc all rights reserved defect density effort estimation

biomedical and software industries congress has shown interest in reform of the existing patent system this attention to patent policy reflects a recognition of the increasing importance of intellectual property to u s innovation patent ownership is perceived as an incentive to the technological advancement that leads to economic growth as such the number of patent applications and grants has grown significantly as have the type and breadth of inventions that can be patented along with the expansion in the number and range of patents there are growing concerns over whether the current system is working efficiently and effectively several recent studies recommend patent reform other experts maintain that major alterations in existing law are unnecessary and that while not perfect the patent process can and is adapting to technological progress several bills e g h r 1908 and s 1145 have been introduced in the 110th congress that would make significant alterations in current patent law at the present time the patent laws provide a system under which all inventions are subject to the same requirements of patentability regardless of the technical field in which they arose however inventors and innovative companies in different industries tend not to hold identical views concerning the importance of patents reflecting varying experiences with the patent system innovators in biomedical industries tend to see patent protection as critically important as a way to prohibit competitors from appropriating the results of a company s research and development efforts typically only a few often one or two patents cover a particular drug in contrast the nature of software development is such that inventions often are cumulative and new products generally embody numerous patentable inventions as a result distinct industries may react differently to patent reform proposals under consideration by the 110th congress this report will be updated if events warrant such action mary ann liebert inc 2008 critical friends groups the possibilities and limitations embedded in teacher professional communities aimed at instructional improvement and school reform background context this study builds upon research on teacher professional communities and high school restructuring reforms it employs a conceptual framework that draws upon theories of community of practice and community of learners purpose objective research question focus of study this study analyzes how teachers professional inquiry communities at the high school level constitute a resource for school reform and instructional improvement setting this research focused on a reforming comprehensive urban public high school with site based management population participants subjects this study investigates the practices of six school based oral inquiry groups known as critical friends groups cfgs which were selected as cases of mature professional communities twenty five teachers and administrators participated as informants research design this research involved a video based qualitative case study data collection and analysis data included observations of cfg meetings interviews with teachers and administrators and document collection analysis entailed coding with qualitative software development of analytic cross cfg meta matrices discourse analytic techniques and joint viewing of video records with informants findings results the author explores four particular design features of cfgs their diverse menu of activities their decentralized structure their interdisciplinary membership and their reliance on structured conversation tools called protocols showing how these features carry within them endemic tensions that compel these professional communities to negotiate a complicated set of professional development choices conclusions recommendations the findings demonstrate how the enactment of design choices holds particular consequences for the nature and quality of teacher learning and school improvement although cfgs enhanced teachers collegial relationships their awareness of research based practices and reforms their schoolwide knowledge and their capacity to undertake instructional improvement these professional communities offered an inevitably partial combination of supports for teacher professional development in particular cfgs exerted minimal influence on teachers pedagogical content knowledge cfgs would benefit from regular and systematic metacognitive and process oriented reflections to identify how their collaborative practices might optimally advance their bottom line goal of improving teacher practice to increase student achievement additionally high schools might pursue multiple and complementary cfg like professional development opportunities in subject matter departments and interdisciplinary grade level academy teams copyright by teachers college columbia university
