mining and recommending software features across multiple web repositories the internetware paradigm is fundamentally changing the traditional way of software development more and more software projects are developed maintained and shared on the internet however a large quantity of heterogeneous software resources have not been organized in a reasonable and efficient way software feature is an ideal material to characterize software resources the effectiveness of feature related tasks will be greatly improved if a multi grained feature repository is available in this paper we propose a novel approach for organizing analyzing and recommend ing software features firstly we construct a hierarchical repository of software feature hesa then we mine the hidden affnities among the features and recommend relevant and high quality features to stakeholders based on hesa finally we conduct a user study to evaluate our approach quantitatively the results show that hesa can organize software features in a more reasonable way compared to the traditional and the state of the art approaches the result of feature recommendation is effective and interesting categories and subject descriptors d

on tology mining software repository recommender system enhancing trustworthiness evaluation in internetware with similarity and non negative constraints internetware is envisioned as a new software paradigm where software developers usually need to interact with unknown partners as well as the software entities developed by them to reduce uncertainty and boost collaborations in such setting it is important to provide trustworthiness evaluation mechanisms so that trustworthy partners entities can be easily found in this work we propose a novel trustworthiness evaluation mechanism by enhancing existing mechanisms with similarity and non negative constraints to be specific we first extend an existing multi aspect trust inference model by incorporating the non negative constraint one of the advantages of such constraint is its strong interpretability second we incorporate similarity into two neighborhood models borrowed from recommender systems when computing similarity we make use of the intermediate results from the first step finally these models are combined under a machine learning framework to show the effectiveness of our method we conduct experiments on a real data set the results show that both our non negativity extension and similarity computation improve the evaluation accuracy of the original methods and the combined method outperforms several state of the art methods internetware multi aspect non negativity similarity trustworthiness evaluation a distributed anonymization scheme for privacy preserving recommendation systems recommendation systems need to collect user personal data for predicting user preferences the privacy of user personal data becomes a main concern when users are served by the recommendation system in this paper we study the problem of privacy preserving recommendation in the case that the user data are locally stored in a distributed manner we present a distributed anonymization scheme based on the proposed anonymization map the proposed scheme allows users individually anonymize their own data without accessing each other s data the experiment results show that the proposed scheme can preserve the privacy of collaborative users and outperform the perturbation based scheme 2013 ieee anonymization privacy recommendation systems a context aware matrix factorization recommender algorithm latent factor models based on matrix tensor factorization techniques are widely recognized in recommender systems however matrix tensor factorization techniques are computationally intensive which greatly limits their usages in real world projects to address this problem we improve the classic matrix factorization models by establishing fuzzy mapping relationships between contexts and latent factors and making use of contextual information to initialize user item feature vectors experimental results on standard test set movielens 1m show that the proposed algorithms could achieve far better prediction accuracy while reducing the iteration number by 25 2013 ieee context latent factor matrix tensor factorization recommender system clustering collaborative filtering recommendation system based on svd algorithm the most important responsibility for every recommendation system is how to make the appropriate personalized recommendation for different customers rapidly and effectively collaborative filtering recommendation is one of the most popular methods among the e commerce system but it still remains some problems such as cold start and data sparse at the same time more and more users registering on make the real time and expansibility of a system hard to be kept in the paper according to a series of problems such as data sparse and bad real time caused by a large number of registering users we propose a new approach combining the clustering algorithm with svd algorithm which is widely used in the domain of image processing into collaborative filtering algorithm firstly we classify the users by using the attributes of them then we decompose the rating matrix with the svd algorithm and reunion them into new rating matrix to calculate the similarity between each pair of users at last we take advantage of the similarity to find the nearest neighbors in the collaborative filtering recommendation and predict the ratings of the items to make the recommendation our experiments show that the approach cannot only improve the cold start and data sparse problems but also increase the efficiency and scalability of a system 2013 ieee clustering collaborative filtering e commerce svd discovery of technical expertise from open source code repositories online question and answer websites for developers have emerged as the main forums for interaction during the software development process the veracity of an answer in such websites is typically verified by the number of upvotes that the answer garners from peer programmers using the same forum although this mechanism has proved to be extremely successful in rating the usefulness of the answers it does not lend itself very elegantly to model the expertise of a user in a particular domain in this paper we propose a model to rank the expertise of the developers in a target domain by mining their activity in different opensource projects to demonstrate the validity of the model we built a recommendation system for stackoverflow which uses the data mined from github github knowledge discovery recommendations source code repository stackoverflow technical expertise investigating confidence displays for top n recommendations recommendation systems often compute fixed length lists of recommended items to users forcing the system to predict a fixed length list for each user may result in different confidence levels for the computed recommendations reporting the system s confidence in its predictions the recommendation strength can provide valuable information to users in making their decisions in this article we investigate several different displays of a system s confidence to users and conclude that some displays are easier to understand and are favored by most users we continue to investigate the effect confidence has on users in terms of their perception of the recommendation quality and the user experience with the system our studies show that it is not easier for users to identify relevant items when confidence is displayed still users appreciate the displays and trust them when the relevance of items is difficult to establish 2013 asis t handling missing attributes using matrix factorization predictive models that use machine learning techniques has been useful tools to guide software project managers in making decisions under uncertainty however in practice collecting metrics or defect data has been a troublesome job and researchers often have to deal with incomplete datasets in their studies as a result both researchers and practitioners shy away from implementing such models missing data is a common problem in other domains to build recommender systems we believe that the techniques used to overcome missing data problem in other domains can also be employed in software engineering in this paper we propose matrix factorization algorithm to tackle with missing data problem in building predictive models in software development domain 2013 ieee matrix factorization missing data software defect prediction a support system for helping to understand a project in software maintenance using the program package name under the global competition of business software development is required to be conducted more efficiently in particular software maintenance holds the majority in the costs of software development developers must understand a project to conduct software maintenance efficiently therefore this study develops a support system for understanding a project in software maintenance this study proposes to use the program package name to utilize function name as the program package name is required by using the name the system extracts associations with parts of functional specification furthermore based on the cosine similarity using the vector space model between design documents or communication messages and the parts extracted by the program package name related artifacts are recommended by

sufficiently in developing modern software systems in spite of the looming threats of global climate change and environmental degradation 1 software companies are more concerned with product time to market than long term product impacts the research goal of this project is to overcome the barriers of incorporating sustainability into the software engineering process through the use of a recommender system to be used during requirements engineering this system will recommend the kinds of sustainability requirements that should be considered in a given system based on application domain deployment locale etc and in so doing will lessen the workload of eliciting appropriate sustainability requirements this research builds on an ongoing research project on software engineering for sustainability 2013 ieee 2013 2nd international workshop on user evaluations for software engineering researchers user 2013 proceedings the proceedings contain 5 papers the topics discussed include empirical evaluation of research prototypes at variable stages of maturity surveying developer knowledge and interest in code smells through online freelance marketplaces how to evaluate a conflict minimizing task scheduler through a user study on planning an evaluation of the impact of identifier names on the readability and quality of smalltalk programs and a proposed recommender system for eliciting software sustainability requirements utilizing software reuse experience for automated test recommendation the development of defect tests is still a very labour intensive process that demands a high level of domain knowledge concentration and problem awareness from software engineers any technology that can reduce the manual effort involved in this process therefore has the potential to significantly reduce software development costs and time consumption an idea for achieving this is to reuse the knowledge bound up in already existing test cases either directly or indirectly to assist in the development of tests for new software components and systems although general software reuse has received a lot of attention in the past both in academia and industry previous research has focussed on the reuse and recommendation of existing software artifacts in the creation of new product code rather than on the recommendation of tests in this paper we focus on the latter and present a novel automated test recommendation approach that leverages lessons learned from traditional software reuse to proactively make test case suggestions while an engineer is developing tests in contrast most existing testing assistance tools provide ex post assistance to test developers in the form of coverage assessments and test quality evaluations our goal is to create an automated non intrusive recommendation system for efficient software test development in this paper we set out the basic strategy by which this can be achieved and present a prototypical implementation of our test recommender system for eclipse 2013 ieee probabilistic topic models for sequence data probabilistic topic models are widely used in different contexts to uncover the hidden structure in large text corpora one of the main and perhaps strong assumption of these models is that generative process follows a bag of words assumption i e each token is independent from the previous one we extend the popular latent dirichlet allocation model by exploiting three different conditional markovian assumptions i the token generation depends on the current topic and on the previous token ii the topic associated with each observation depends on topic associated with the previous one iii the token generation depends on the current and previous topic for each of these modeling assumptions we present a gibbs sampling procedure for parameter estimation experimental evaluation over real word data shows the performance advantages in terms of recall and precision of the

generating recommendations in open journal systems the use of articles from scientific journals is an important part of research based teaching at universities the selection of relevant work from among the increasing amount of scientific literature can be problematic the challenge is to find relevant recommendations especially when the related articles are not obviously linked this paper seeks to discuss these issues this paper focuses on the analysis of user activity traces in journals using the open source software open journal the research questions to what extent end users follow a certain link structure given within ojs or immediately select the articles according to their interests in the latter case the recorded data sets are used for creating further recommendations the analysis is based on an article matrix displaying the usage frequency of articles and their user selected successive articles within the ojs furthermore the navigation paths are analysed it was found that the users tend to follow a set navigation structure moreover a hybrid recommendation system for ojs is described which uses content based filtering as the basic system extended by the results of a collaborative filtering approach the paper presents two original contributions the analysis of user path tracing and a novel algorithm that allows smooth integration of new articles into the existing recommendations due to the fact that scientific journals are published in a frequent and regular time sequence 2013 emerald group publishing limited algorithms open journal system path

technology evaluating software quality in use using user reviews mining reviews of software from experienced users play an important role for software acquisition decision in order to share their experiences an online software recommendation system has been developed this information is not only useful for users or customers but it is also be used for evaluating the software since there are many of reviews are accumulated and expressed in both formal and informal written languages it takes time for concluding the evaluation therefore we are interested in an automatically process to extract software information attributes from the reviews in order to provide software review representation one essential problem is the different sentiment of the same sentence in different environment to solve this problem rule based classification is used as our machine learning model in this research software quality extracted from user perspective with respect to iso 9126 is selected to be the characteristic model we also propose a methodology for a software product reviews mining based on software quality ontology and a product software quality in use scores for software review

more and more important either as a means of communication or as parts of realizations unfortunately these models are rarely reused which might be due to poor tool support a model recommender system is one possible way out but it bases on high quality data which is most likely stored in a database and needs to blend into an environment hence approaching model recommendations in a model driven way

conflict resolution support for parallel software development parallel changes in which separate lines of development are carried out by different developments are a basic fact of developing and

calculates user preferences on attribute classes abey refines these preferences by wiping off some interferences and allocates a group of such preferences for each user at the end of measurement abey could re rank given recommendations according to aggregate attribute class preferences for them experiments are conducted on data sets collected from an e commerce site in real world the effectiveness of abey including accuracy coverage and novelty has been evaluated and the results indicate that abey can be a superior alternative to user profile on finding related items for individuals attribute entropy personalized method recommender systems user preference user profile a new similarity function for selecting neighbors for each target item in collaborative filtering as one of the collaborative filtering cf techniques memory based cf technique which recommends items to users based on rating information of like minded users called neighbors has been widely used and has also proven to be useful in many practices in the age of information overload however there is still considerable room for improving the quality of recommendation shortly similarity functions in traditional cf compute a similarity between a target user and the other user without considering a target item more specifically they give an equal weight to each of the co rated items rated by both users neighbors of a target user therefore are identical for all target items however a reasonable assumption is that the similarity between a target item and each of the co rated items should be considered when finding neighbors of a target user additionally a different set of neighbors should be selected for each different target item thus the objective of this paper is to propose a new similarity function in order to select different neighbors for each different target item in the new similarity function the rating of a user on an item is weighted by the item similarity between the item and the target item experimental results from movielens dataset and netflix dataset provide evidence that our recommender model considerably outperforms the traditional cf based recommender model 2012 elsevier b v all rights reserved collaborative filtering information overload item similarity recommendation system comparing collaborative filtering methods based on user topic ratings copyright 2013 by knowledge systems institute graduate school user based collaborative filtering cf has been successfully applied into recommender system for years the main idea of user based cf is to discover communities of users sharing similar interests however existing user based cf methods may be inaccurate due to the problem of data sparsity one possible way to improve it is to append new data sources into user based cf tags which are added and generated by users is one of the new sources in order to utilize tags effectively user topic based cf is proposed to extract features behind tags assign them to topics and measure users preferences on these topics in this paper we conduct comparisons between two user topic based cf methods based on different tag topic relations both methods calculate user topic preferences according to ratings of items and topic weights experiments are conducted on the data set of movielens the results show that usertopic based cf method is better than user based cf both in computational efficiency and recommendation effect the effects are significant especially when each tag belongs to multiple topics collaborative filtering recommender systems tag topic model blog recommender based on hypergraph modeling clustering algorithm in this paper we presents a new blog recommender based on the hyper graph modeling clustering algorithm the algorithm of this system is called multilevel clustering segmentation algorithm based on the hyper graph model under the hyper graph model each blog will be abstracted as a vertex of a hyper graph hyper edges will be built among the blogs which belong to the same result set gotten through the google blog searching by one keyword then the problem of recommender is translated into the clustering of a hyper graph our multilevel clustering algorithm is then used to do the segmentation and we set a new optimization index for the segmentation of a hyper graph which is called modularity through the definition of modularity it is not necessary for us to preset the partitioning number any more we do the segmentation with the aim to achieve the optimum value of modularity in addition hyper graph is born with the ability to solve problems with high dimension data and this ability of course will lead to more reasonable results compared with other models 2013 ieee hypergraph model modularity multilevel

code examples on application programming interfaces apis to facilitate their development processes however api documents often do not include enough information for developers to fully understand how to use the apis and searching for good code examples requires considerable effort to address this problem we propose a novel code example recommendation system that combines the strength of browsing documents and searching for code examples and returns api documents embedded with high quality code example summaries mined from the web our evaluation results show that our approach provides code

projects at microsoft with the goal to facilitate analyses on software projects those projects provide databases with metadata of the development process which developers managers and researchers can use as an example the data can be used for recommendation systems and bug analyses in the research field of visualization software there are a lot of approaches that try to visualize large software

that uses the city metaphor the goal is to guide managers and developers in their day to day development decisions and to improve the comprehension of their software projects seeking the ground truth a retroactive study on the evolution and migration of software libraries application programming interfaces apis are a common and industrially relevant means for third party software developers to reuse external functionality several techniques have been proposed to help migrate client code between library versions with incompatible apis but it is not clear how well these perform in an absolute sense we present a retroactive study into the presence and nature of api incompatibilities between several versions of a set of java based software libraries for each we perform a detailed manual analysis to determine what the correct adaptations are to migrate from the older to the newer version in addition we investigate whether any of a set of adaptation recommender techniques is capable of identifying the correct adaptations for library migration we find that a given api incompatibility can typically be addressed by only one or two recommender techniques but sometimes none serve furthermore those techniques give correct recommendations on average in only about 20 of cases 2012 acm adaptive change api recommendation systems who is going to mentor newcomers in open source projects when newcomers join a software project they need to be properly trained to understand the technical and organizational aspects of the project inadequate training could likely lead to project delay or failure in this paper we propose an approach named yoda young and newcomer developer assistant aimed at identifying and recommending mentors in software projects by mining data from mailing lists and versioning systems candidate mentors are identified among experienced developers who actively interact with newcomers then when a newcomer joins the project yoda recommends her a mentor that among the available ones has already discussed topics relevant for the newcomer yoda has been evaluated on software repositories of five open source projects we have also surveyed some developers of these projects to understand whether mentoring was actually performed in their projects and asked them to evaluate the mentoring relations yoda identified results indicate that top committers are not always the most appropriate mentors and show the potential usefulness of yoda as a recommendation system to aid project managers in supporting newcomers joining a software project 2012 acm developer mentoring empirical studies mining software repositories a source code recommender system to support newcomers newcomers in a software development project often need assistance to complete their first tasks then a mentor an experienced member of the team usually teaches the newcomers what they need to complete their tasks but to allocate an experienced member of a team to teach a newcomer during a long time is neither always possible nor desirable because the mentor could be more helpful doing more important tasks during the development the team interacts with a version control system bug tracking and mailing lists and all these tools record data creating the project memory recommender systems can use the project memory to help newcomers in some tasks answering their questions thus in some cases the developers do not need a mentor in this paper we present mentor a recommender system to help newcomers to solve change requests mentor uses the prediction by partial matching ppm algorithm and some heuristics to analyze the change requests and the version control data and recommend potentially relevant source code that will help the developer in the change request solution we did three experiments to compare the ppm algorithm with the latent semantic indexing lsi using ppm we achieved results for recall rate between 37 and 66 8 and using lsi the results were between 20 3

difficulties in implementing exception handling code in their systems in particular they fail in implementing appropriate handling actions not surprisingly recurring failures and performance issues are often related to the poor exception handling actions implemented in real software systems in this paper we propose implement and evaluate a set of three heuristic strategies used to recommend exception handling code in programming tasks given a method in which the developer wants to handle an exception the heuristics recommend a list of code fragments implementing exception handling the heuristics goal is to accurately find code fragments implementing exception handling and recommend these fragments according to the context of developers implementation task hence the proposed heuristics may assist developers in the process of discovering exception handling actions relevant to their context by providing concrete examples we believe that a recommender system based on the proposed heuristics may be used in the future as a tool for aiding exception handling implementation 2012 ieee code example recommendation exception handling heuristic strategies breaking the big bang practice of traceability pushing timely trace recommendations to project stakeholders in many software intensive systems traceability is used to support a variety of software engineering activities such as impact analysis compliance verification and requirements validation however in practice traceability links are often created towards the end of the project specifically for approval or certification purposes this practice can result in inaccurate and incomplete traces and also means that traceability links are not available to support early development efforts we address these problems by presenting a trace recommender system which pushes recommendations to project stakeholders as they create or modify traceable artifacts we also introduce the novel concept of a trace obligation which is used to track satisfaction relations between a target artifact and a set of source artifacts we model traceability events and subsequent actions including user recommendations using the business process modeling notation bpmn we demonstrate and evaluate the efficacy of our approach through an illustrative example and a simulation conducted using the software engineering artifacts of a robotic system for supporting arm rehabilitation our results show that tracking trace obligations and generating trace recommendations throughout the active phases of a project can lead to early construction of traceability knowledge 2012 ieee maintenance requirements traceability trace obligation resyster a hybrid recommender system for scrum team roles based on fuzzy and rough sets

within the scope of software development projects at our university where development teams interacted with a requirements prioritization environment the major result of our study is that anonymized preference elicitation can help to significantly improve the quality of requirements prioritization for example in terms of the degree of team consensus prioritization diversity and quality of the resulting software components group decision making requirements prioritization design pattern selection a solution strategy method design patterns represent a highly effective way to improve the

patterns this increases the degree of challenges that face the developer in determining the suitable design patterns this paper presents method to facilitate and assist the designers in selecting the

applications of machine learning systems the reliability of such systems is also becoming increasingly important a necessary step for ensuring reliability of such systems is to understand the features and characteristics of bugs occurred in the systems a number of studies have investigated bugs and fixes in various software systems but none focuses on machine learning systems machine learning systems are unique due to their algorithm intensive nature and applications to potentially large scale data and thus deserve a special consideration in this study we fill the research gap by performing an empirical study on the bugs in machine learning systems we analyze three systems apache mahout lucene and opennlp which are data mining information retrieval and natural language processing tools respectively we look into their bug databases and code repositories analyze a sample set of bugs and corresponding fixes and label the bugs into various categories our study finds that 22 6 of the bugs belong to the algorithm method category 15 6 of the bugs belong to the non functional category and 13 of the bugs belong to the assignment initialization category we also report the relationship between bug categories and bug severities the time and effort needed to fix the bugs and bug impacts we highlight several bug categories that deserve attention in future research 2012

allocating hundreds of test cases among several testers objective in this paper we propose and evaluate 2 assignment algorithms for test case allocation and 3 tester profiles based on recommender systems each assignment algorithm can be combined with 3 tester profiles which results in six possible allocation systems method we run a controlled experiment that uses 100 test suites each one with at least 50 test cases from a real industrial setting in order to compare our allocation systems to the manager s allocation in terms of precision recall and unassignment percentage of test cases the algorithm could not allocate results in our experiment the statistical analysis shows that one of the systems outperforms the others with respect to the precision and recall metrics for unassignment three of our six allocation systems achieved zero best value for the unassignment rate conclusion the results of our experiment suggest that in similar environments test managers can use our allocation systems to reduce the amount of time spent in the test case allocation task in the real industrial setting in which our work was developed managers spend from 16 to 30 working days a year on test case allocation our algorithms can help them do it faster and better copyright 2012 acm manual testing recommender systems test allocation user weight model for item based recommendation systems nowadays item based collaborative filtering cf has been widely used as an effective way to help people cope with information overload it computes the item item similarities differentials and then selects the most similar items for prediction a weakness of current typical itembased cf approaches is that all users have the same weight in computing the item relationships in order to improve the recommendation quality we incorporate users weights based on a relationship model of users into item similarities and differentials computing in this paper a model of user relationship a method for computing users weights and weight based item item similarities differentials computing approaches are proposed for item based cf recommendations finally we experimentally evaluate our approach for recommendation and compare it to typical item based cf approaches based on adjusted cosine and slope one the experiments show that our approaches can improve the recommendation results of them

developer programming in an object oriented programming language deals with a source code structure that may contain hundreds of source code elements these elements are commonly related to each other and working on a specific element may require the developer to access other related elements we propose a recommendation ap proach that uses the context of the developer to retrieve and rank recommendations of relevant source code elements in the ide these recommendations provide a shortcut to reach the desired elements and increase the awareness of the developer in relation to elements that may be of interest in that moment we have tested our approach with a group of developers and the results show that context has a promis ing role in predicting and ranking the source code elements

of the recommender system as well as in its performance in this paper we present a memory based collaborative filtering similarity measure that provides extremely high quality and balanced results these results are complemented with a low processing time high performance similar to the one required to execute traditional similarity metrics the experiments have been carried out on the movielens

large set of possibilities for a given vision task is a surprisingly difficult problem especially if there is limited evaluation data with which to distinguish among models such as when choosing the best walk action classifier from a large pool of classifiers tuned for different viewing angles lighting conditions and background clutter in this paper we suggest that this problem of selecting a good model can be recast as a recommendation problem where the goal is to recommend a good model for a particular task based on how well a limited probe set of models appears to perform through this conceptual remapping we can bring to bear all the collaborative filtering techniques developed for consumer recommender systems e g netflix amazon com we test this hypothesis on action recognition and

fruitful achievements have been made in this area nevertheless the previous preference models mainly focus on the content of books and ignore the attribute of price of a book in an actual book recommendation system the price influences the consumers buying behavior to a large extent and should be considered seriously based on the existing preference models in addition to the attributes of

taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium scale organization decided to adopt software platforms the study also reveals how new trends in software engineering i e agile methods distributed development and flat management structures interplayed with the chosen platform strategy method we used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium scale company in scandinavia we conducted 16 in depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams three of which were working on three separate platforms the collected data was analyzed using grounded

of omission are harder for programmers to detect than errors of commission while several change recommendation systems already exist to prevent or reduce omission errors during software development there have been very few studies on why errors of omission occur in practice and how such errors could be prevented in order to understand the characteristics of omission errors this paper investigates a group of bugs that were fixed more than once in open source projects those bugs whose initial patches were later considered incomplete and to which programmers applied supplementary patches our study on eclipse jdt core eclipse swt and mozilla shows that a significant portion of resolved bugs 22 to 33 involves more than one fix attempt our manual inspection shows that the causes of omission errors are diverse including missed porting changes incorrect handling of conditional statements or incomplete refactorings etc while many consider that missed updates to code clones often lead to omission errors only a very small portion of supplementary patches 12 in jdt 25 in swt and 9 in mozilla have a content similar to their initial patches this implies that supplementary change locations cannot be predicted by code clone analysis alone furthermore 14 to 15 of files in supplementary patches are beyond the scope of immediate neighbors of their initial patch locations they did not overlap with the initial patch locations nor had direct structural dependencies on them e g calls accesses subtyping relations etc these results call for new types of omission error prevention

system designers have to adhere to a significant number of functional and non functional requirements which makes software development a complex engineering task if these requirements change during the development process complexity even increases in this paper we suggest recommendation systems based on context aware composition to enable a system designer to postpone and automate decisions regarding efficiency non functional requirements such as performance and focus on the design of the core functionality of the system instead context aware composition suggests the optimal component variants of a system for different static contexts e g software and hardware environment or even different dynamic contexts e g actual parameters and resource utilization thus an efficiency non

given change request is a time consuming process in large software systems various approaches have been proposed to automate this activity e g based on information retrieval the performance of a particular prediction approach often highly depends on attributes like coding style or writing style of change request thus we propose to use multiple prediction approaches in combination with machine

problem solving situations for instance it is common the occurrence of exceptions that originate stack traces in the console view of the ide these situations motivate the developer to use the web to search for information however there is a gap between the ide and the web requiring developers to spend significant time searching for relevant information and navigating through web pages in a web browser we propose to process the information of exception stack traces and retrieve question answering web resources to help developers we developed a tool that integrates recommendation of question

helping developers to prioritize their removal by ranking them we detect code anomaly patterns based on static analysis that also exploit architecture information 2012 ieee architectural problem code

accordingly to address this problem a novel cascade recommender framework which incorporates scholar s background knowledge using ontological concepts into the user profiles is proposed the framework

of the most critical phases in software development processes requirements are verbalizing decision alternatives which are negotiated by stakeholders in this paper we present the results of an empirical analysis of the effects of applying group recommendation technologies to requirements negotiation this analysis has been conducted within the scope of software development projects at our university where development teams were supported with group recommendation technologies when deciding which requirements should be implemented we summarize the results of this analysis and show how group recommendation can be applied to requirements negotiation knowledge engineering support for agent oriented software reuse automating software engineering tasks is essential to achieve better productivity in software development and quality of software products knowledge engineering can address this challenge through the representation and reuse of knowledge of how and when to perform a development task this chapter describes a knowledge based approach for automating agent oriented development whose main components are a software process madae pro and an integrated development environment madaeide madae pro is an ontology driven process for multi agent domain and application engineering which promotes the construction and reuse of agent oriented application families madae ide is an integrated development environment which assists developers in the application of madae pro allowing full or partial automation of its modeling tasks through a set of production rules that explores the semantic representation of modeling products in its knowledge base the approach has been evaluated through the development of a multi agent system family of recommender systems supporting alternative collaborative content based and hybrid filtering techniques some examples from these case studies are presented to illustrate and detail the domain analysis and application requirements engineering tasks of madae pro 2011 igi global subjectivity handling of ratings for trust and reputation systems an abductive reasoning approach the majority of trust models consider two types of knowledge in estimating the trustworthiness of a trustee in an interaction experiences and recommendations however this leads to a nested trust problem how could we trust the recommendations even when the recommenders are not deceptive there is still a trust related problem due to the subjectivity of human judgment this paper describes a missing part of the existing trust management models handling the subjectivity of recommendations our approach is based on the idea that a recommender s judgment method can be inferred and the recommended entity can be re evaluated according to the value system of the truster who is about to make a decision extraction of the judgment method involves abductive reasoning which is implemented in the proposed account using subjective logic this approach has been quantitatively compared with two other methods our experiments show that our proposed solution outperforms an extended version of the beta trust model a trust model without subjectivity elimination our suggested method for trust and reputation systems may also be applied to other systems that include a rating mechanism such as recommender systems abductive reasoning rating recommender

the navigability of web based information systems do teams achieve usability goals evaluating goal achievement with usability goals setting tool do teams achieve important usability goals most of the time further is goal achievement uniform or are practitioners more mindful of some goals than others this paper presents an empirical study on usability goal achievement in industry projects we used usability goal setting tool ugt a recommender system that helps teams set prioritize and evaluate usability goals the practitioner creates profiles for the product and its users based on these inputs ugt helps the practitioner break down high level usability goals into more specific goal parameters and provides recommendations examples and guidelines to assign weights to these parameters ugt suggests strategies to evaluate goal parameters after the design is ready and assign them scores ugt was used to collect data from 65 projects in the indian software industry in which participants assigned weights and scores to the goal parameters the 30 goal parameters suggested by ugt were found to be internally reliable and having acceptable granularity and coverage it was observed that goal parameter weights and scores correlated but only moderately another interesting observation was that more than a third of the important goal parameters did not score well we identify eight goal parameters that are typically high weighted but have poor weight score correlations we call these latent but important goal parameters design teams will do well to pay closer attention to these goal parameters during projects 2011 ifip international federation for information processing design tools latent goals methods usability goal parameters usability goals achievement an item based collaborative filtering method using item based hybrid similarity item based collaborative filtering is a preferred technique on recommender system it uses a value of item rating similarity to predict user s preference in this paper we include values of item attribute similarity to adjust the predicted rating equation for target item the results of item based collaborative filtering that hybrid item rating similarity and item attribute similarity techniques have mean absolute error mae less than a traditional item based collaborative filtering technique and others the proposed algorithm is efficient to predict better than traditional algorithm as shown in our experiments 2011 ieee collaborative filtering item based collaborative filtering recommendation system improving rating estimation in recommender using demographic data and expert opinions memory based collaborative filtering algorithms have been widely adopted in many popular recommender systems however the rating data are very sparse which affects prediction accuracy greatly to solve this problem we use expert opinions to improve prediction accuracy firstly we propose a novel similarity measure in order to highlight users background then combining users ratings with expert opinions the prediction get a right balance in both expert professional opinions and similar users finally since svd based collaborative filtering algorithms shows good performance on the prevention of noise we use it to smooth the prediction experiments of movielens have shown that our proposed method improves recommendation quality obviously 2011 ieee collaborative filtering data sparsity demography expert recommendation preventing recommendation attack in trust based recommender systems despite its success similarity based collaborative filtering suffers from some limitations such as scalability sparsity and recommendation attack prior work has shown incorporating trust mechanism into traditional collaborative filtering recommender systems can improve these limitations we argue that trust based recommender systems are facing novel recommendation attack which is different from the profile injection attacks in traditional recommender system to the best of our knowledge there has not any prior study on recommendation attack in a trust based recommender system we analyze the attack problem and find that victim nodes play a significant role in the attack furthermore we propose a data provenance method to trace malicious users and identify the victim nodes as distrust users

lineage trust propagation towards the automatic generation of a semantic web ontology for musical instruments in this study we present a novel hybrid system by developing a formal method of automatic ontology generation for web based audio signal processing applications an ontology is seen as a knowledge management structure that represents domain knowledge in a machine interpretable format it describes concepts and relationships within a particular domain in our case the domain of musical instruments the different tasks of ontology engineering including manual annotation hierarchical structuring and organisation of data can be laborious and challenging for these reasons we investigate how the process of creating ontologies can be made less dependent on human supervision by exploring concept analysis techniques in a semantic web environment only a few methods have been proposed for automatic ontology generation these are mostly based on statistical methods e g frequency of semantic tags that generate the taxonomy structure of ontologies as in the studies from bodner and songs 1 the algorithms that have been used for automatic ontology generation are hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac bi section k means 2 and formal concept analysis fcm formal concept analysis is a well established technique for identifying groups of elements with common sets of properties formal concept analysis has been used in many software engineering topics such as the identication of ob jects in legacy code or the identication and restructuring of schema in ob ject oriented databases 5 these works are important since ontologies provide the basis for information and database systems 6 in this study we present a novel hybrid ontology generation system for musical instruments the music ontology is a semantic web ontology that describes music related information e g release artist performance but does not provide models of musical instruments hence there is a need to develop a separate instrument ontology to deepen how music knowledge is represented on the se mantic web such complementary knowledge on musical instruments can be useful to develop music recognition and recommendation systems based on semantic reasoning this work is a preliminary step which focuses on automatic instrument taxonomy generation in ontology web language owl the taxonomy of musical instruments given by hornbostel and sachs 3 was considered as the basis for our instrument terms and initial hierarchical structure the hybrid system consists of three main units i musical instrument analysis ii formal concept analysis iii lattice pruning and hierarchical form generation in the musical instrument analysis unit the system analyses the relationships between 12 predened classes of musical instruments chordophones aerophones bowed struck reed pipe instruments edge instruments brass instruments double reeds single reeds with valves without valves true utes and 10 musical instrument individuals bassoon cello clarinet flute oboe piano saxophone trombone tuba violin using a multi layer perceptron mlp classier the underlying audio features used in the recognition and classication system are the line spectral frequencies lsf which are derived from linear predictive analysis of the signal the lsf characterise well the timbral differences between instruments since they are related to the formant structure of the sounds spectral envelope which is an important aspect of the timbre in this study we used a database of isolated tones of various pitches and dynamics to train and test the system in the formal concept analysis unit the binary relations obtained from the mlp outputs are used to identify the common attributes individuals shared by different objects and generate a concept lattice form in the lattice pruning unit the concepts are ordered in the hierarchical concept order and a well structured hierarchical form using reduced label ling technique is created finally the reduced concept lattice labels and the class hierarchy of the instrument ontology is coded to the ontology web language by using the owl api java library 4 the results have given a conclusive evidence in favor of the hierarchical similarity to the taxonomy of musical instruments used as a reference 3 to the authors knowledge this is the rst study to investigate automatic ontology generation system in the context of audio and music analysis in further stages the outcomes of this work may be used in an application to establish an automated mechanism to identify and classify music sources and annotate them with rdf meta data we will also incorporate a wider set of musical instruments and use more owl language features e g ob ject data properties

important support for information search from huge amounts of data since some of those information may be of interest of users but hard to be searched manually according to forecasts data production

features for a given domain our approach mines product descriptions from publicly available online specifications utilizes text mining and a novel incremental diffusive clustering algorithm to discover domain specific features generates a probabilistic feature model that represents commonalities variants and cross category features and then uses association rule mining and the k nearest neighbor machine learning strategy to generate product specific feature recommendations our recommender system supports the relatively labor intensive task of domain analysis potentially increasing opportunities for re use reducing time to market and delivering more competitive software products the approach is empirically validated against 20 different product categories using thousands of product descriptions mined from a repository of free software applications 2011 acm clustering domain analysis recommender systems the code orb supporting contextualized coding via at a glance views nier track while code is typically presented as a flat file to a developer who must change it this flat file exists within a context that can drastically influence how a developer approaches changing it while the developer clearly must be careful changing any code they probably should be yet more careful in changing code that recently saw major changes is barely covered by test cases and was the source of a number of bugs contextualized coding refers to the ability of the developer to effectively use such contextual information while they work on some changes in this paper we introduce the code orb a contextualized coding tool that builds upon existing mining and analysis techniques to warn developers on a line by line basis of the volatility of the code they are working on the key insight underneath the code orb is that it is neither desired nor possible to always present a code s context in its entirety instead it is necessary to provide an abstracted view of the context that informs the developer of which parts of the code they need to pay more attention to this paper discusses the principles of and rationale behind contextualized coding introduces the code orb and illustrates its function with example code and context drawn from the mylyn 11 project 2011 acm code orb contextualized coding recommendation systems software visualization dynamic updating of online recommender systems via feed forward controllers recommender systems have become an essential software component of many online businesses supporting customers in finding the items e g books on amazon movies on netflix songs on last fm they are interested in key to their success is the level of accuracy they achieve the more precisely they can predict how much a customer will enjoy an item the higher the profit that the business will make e g in terms of more purchases in quantifying the accuracy of recommender systems the evaluation methodology followed by researchers has so far neglected an important aspect that these businesses grow continuously over time both in terms of users and items the data structures used by the recommender system to compute predictions become stale and thus have to be updated regularly intuitively the more often the data structures are being updated the higher the accuracy achieved but the higher the computational cost afforded because of the extremely large volume of data being handled system administrators often perform the update at fixed intervals of time e g weekly fortnightly in an effort to balance accuracy versus cost we argue that such an approach benefits neither accuracy nor cost as businesses do not grow linearly in time thus risking the fixed update interval to be at times too coarse with negative impact on accuracy and at other times too fine grained with negative impact on cost we thus advocate for a self monitoring and self adaptive approach whereby the system monitors its own growth over time estimates the loss in accuracy it would endure if an update were not being performed based on the observed growth and dynamically decides whether the benefit of performing an update accuracy outweighs its computational cost using real data from the bibsonomy website we demonstrate how this simple technique enables system administrators to transparently balance these two conflicting requirements 2011 acm recommender systems self adaptation self monitoring an empirical study of long lived code clones previous research has shown that refactoring code clones as soon as they are formed or discovered is not always feasible or worthwhile to perform since some clones never change during evolution and some disappear in a short amount of time while some undergo repetitive similar edits over their long lifetime toward a long term goal of developing a recommendation system that selectively identifies clones to refactor as a first step we conducted an empirical investigation into the characteristics of long lived clones our study of 13558 clone genealogies from 7 large open source projects over the history of 33 25 years in total found surprising results the size of a clone the number of clones in the same group and the method level distribution of clones are not strongly correlated with the survival time of clones however the number of developers who modified clones and the time since the last addition or removal of a clone to its group are highly correlated with the survival time of clones this result indicates that the evolutionary characteristics of clones may be a better indicator for refactoring needs than static or spatial characteristics such as loc the number of clones in the same group or the dispersion of clones in a system 2011 springer verlag code clones empirical study refactoring software evolution towards a recommendation system for the use of web based collaborative tools in factory planning web based collaborative tools also often referred to as web 2 0 tools facilitate multiple ways of cooperation such as the common work on documents improved task centered communication or the general coordination of tasks today s factory planning especially in the context of the digital factory concept is mainly focused on digital models and methods of visualization and simulation of the shop floor what it lacks is an explicit systematic approach for a profound support of cooperation through web based collaborative tools in similar knowledge intensive disciplines such as e learning or software engineering these tools have already become common practice and

identifying extract class opportunities through game theory in software engineering developers must often find solutions to problems balancing competing goals e g quality versus cost time to market versus resources or cohesion versus coupling finding a suitable balance between contrasting goals is often complex and recommendation systems are useful to support developers and managers in performing such a complex task we believe that contrasting goals can be often dealt with game theory techniques indeed game theory is successfully used in other fields especially in economics to mathematically propose solutions to strategic situation in which an individual s success in making choices depends on the choices of others to demonstrate the applicability of game theory to software engineering and to understand its pros and cons we propose an approach based on game theory that recommend extract class refactoring opportunities a preliminary evaluation inspired by mutation testing demonstrates the applicability and the benefits of the proposed approach 2010 ieee game theory quality metrics refactoring a know how recommendation system for a software engineering project course by

know who systems the target of this study is education domain and developers are university students they are novice for software development and they leave the course after finishing it therefore know how acquisition and sharing are very important the authors developed a know how recommendation system using the content filtering technique of which targets are stored know how and inquiry sentences written in natural language the results of a preliminary experiment in a project based course of a university showed that the system could recommend appropriate pieces of know how for four

on a large range of problems it is also known for requiring significant amounts of storage for each user or item to be added to the database this is a problem whenever the collaborative filtering task

important impacts on recommender systems for example the complexity of similarity calculation is increased and more resources are consumed during the process for generating recommendations in this

assess the viability of this concept by evaluating expert recommendations for the aspectj and eclipse projects we find that both usage and implementation expertise have comparable levels of accuracy which suggests that usage expertise may be used as a substitute measure we also find a notable overlap of method calls across both projects which suggests that usage expertise can be leveraged to

supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders the framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view conflicts interests and tradeoffs are

technologies to facilitate stakeholder collaboration in a large scale distributed project our proposed recommender model is a hybrid one designed to manage the placement of stakeholders into highly focused discussion forums where they can work collaboratively to generate requirements in our approach statements of need are first gathered from the project stakeholders unsupervised clustering techniques are then used to identify cohesive and finely grained themes and a users profile is constructed according to the interests of the stakeholders in each of these themes this profile feeds

suggests that developer investigative behaviour is positively influenced by the use of the recommendation system 2009 ieee code analysis cost pragmatic software reuse tasks recommendation systems retroactive evaluation source structural relevance triage decisions improving api usage through automatic detection of redundant code software projects often rely on third party libraries made accessible through application programming interfaces apis we have observed many cases where apis are used in ways that are not the most effective we developed a technique and tool support to automatically detect such patterns of api usage in software projects the main hypothesis underlying our technique is that client code imitating the behavior of an api method without calling it may not be using the api effectively because it could instead call the method it imitates our technique involves analyzing software systems to detect cases of api method imitations in addition to warning developers of potentially reimplemented api methods we also indicate how to improve the use of the api applying our approach on 10 java systems revealed over 400 actual cases of potentially suboptimal api usage leading to many improvements to the quality of the code we studied 2009 ieee api usage code analysis code quality recommendation system on what basis to recommend changesets or interactions different flavours of recommendation systems have been proposed to help software developers perform software evolution tasks a number of these recommendation systems are based on changesets when changeset information is used recommendations are based on only the end result of the activity undertaken to complete a task in this paper we report on an investigation that compared how recommendations based on changesets compare to recommendations based on interactions collected as a programmer performed the task that resulted in a changeset to provide a common basis for the comparison our investigation considered how bug reports considered similar based on changeset information compare to bug reports considered similar based on interaction information we found that there is no direct relationship between the bug reports found similar with the different methods suggesting that each comparison methods captures a different aspect of the problem 2009 ieee challenges in

of potentially useful tools within these ides that might help them complete their work more effectively to improve both awareness and use of tools within an ide we have been developing a recommendation system called spyglass that recommends tool s that might help a developer navigate information available in an ide more efficiently when designing such a recommendation system important considerations are both the content of the recommendations and the form and manner in which those recommendations are made in this paper we focus on what we learned about the form and manner of making tool recommendations from a longitudinal user study of spyglass these results may be useful to others designing various kinds of recommendation systems for ides 2009 ieee a score automatic software

addresses this problem through proposing an open inclusive and robust elicitation and prioritization process that utilizes data mining and recommender technologies to facilitate the active involvement

the course of a framework s evolution changes ranging from a simple refactoring to a complete rearchitecture can break client programs finding suitable replacements for framework elements that were accessed by a client program and deleted as part of the framework s evolution can be a challenging task we present a recommendation system semdiff that suggests adaptations to client programs by

large potentials for further recommendation scenarios we introduce a novel landscape of software development recommendation systems and line out several scenarios for knowledge sharing and collaboration basic challenges are improving context awareness and particularly addressing information providers copyright 2008 acm comparing the use of traditional and associative classifiers towards personalized recommendations nowadays there is a diversity of methods including data mining techniques available to be used in recommender systems however such systems still present numerous limitations an alternative data mining technique is the classification based on association which combines concepts from classification and association in this way association rules perform a predictive role these techniques not very extended have not been applied in the recommender systems area in order to provide recommendations more effectively in this work we suggest that associative classifiers can be also used in these type of systems therefore a revision about the recommender systems and the methods of associative classification is presented in addition a case study is described in which traditional and associative classifiers are evaluated and compared using data from recommender systems the results showed that both type of classifiers can be applied effectively in

built with the help of special purpose software components and programming environments such as rule engines or prolog interpreters other parts of the application like the web interface are however built with standard software development technology like java which means that not only the corresponding interfaces and data exchange mechanisms between the components have to be developed but also that the software developers have to work with different technologies or even programming paradigms in this paper we show how recent scripting extensions in a programming language like java can be exploited to develop highly flexible and extensible knowledge intensive applications the different advantages of such an approach are discussed based on the experiences gained from developing a scripting based software library for building knowledge based recommender applications not all classes are created equal toward a recommendation system for focusing testing when evolving an object oriented system one relevant question is the following given a finite amount of resources what are the most critical classes on which testers should focus their attention in this paper we propose a new way for identifying critical classes classes often changed and playing a key role in the system we rely on error correcting graph matching ecgm and random walks to associate each class with a pair of values representative of the frequency of changes and the class overall connectivity with those two metrics we have a grid for assessing the criticality of any class in the system classes with high values in both metrics should be identified and reported to developers as a residual error in those classes will more likely deeply impact the whole system we show the feasibility of the proposed

that are likely to be related to a function of interest inspired by kleinberg s work 10 we approximate the steady state of an infi nite random walk on a subset of a callgraph in order to rank the functions by their steady state probabilities surprisingly this purely structural approach works quite well our approach like that of robillard s suade algorithm 15 and earlier data mining approaches 13 relies solely on the always available current state of the code rather than other sources such as comments documentation or revision information using the apache api documentation as an oracle we perform a quantitative evaluation of our method finding that our algorithm dramatically improves upon suade in this setting we also find that the performance of traditional data mining approaches is

software organisations mature their repositories of reusable software components from previous projects will also grow considerably remaining conversant with all components in such a repository presents a significant challenge to developers indeed the retrieval of a particular component in this large search space may prove problematic further to this the reuse of components developed in an agile environment is likely to be hampered by the existence of little or no support materials we propose to infer the need for a component and proactively recommend that component to the developer using a technique which is consistent with the principles of agile methodologies our rascal recommender agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers to recommend to an individual developer components that are expected to be needed by that developer unlike many traditional recommender systems we may recommend items that the developer has actually employed previously we introduce a content based filtering technique for ordering the set of recommended software components and present a comparative analysis of applying this technique to a number of collaborative filtering

change to existing work practices we report an exploratory case study evaluating whether software developers who are new to a project can benefit from the artifacts that hipikat recommends from the project memory to assess the appropriateness of the recommendations we investigated when and how developers queried the project memory how they evaluated the recommended artifacts and the process by which they utilized the artifacts we found that newcomers did use the recommendations and their final solutions exploited the recommended artifacts although most of the hipikat queries came in the

focused on a task to investigate this issue we created an online game playing task and paired subjects to perform the task based on their responses to a short survey about demographics and interests we studied how these factors influence task outcomes the interaction process and attitudes towards one s partner we found that demographic similarity affected how people interact with each other even though this information was not explicit while similarities or differences in task relevant interests did not our findings suggest guidelines for developing social recommender systems and show the

addition we find that this effect is moderated by an important property of the marketplace the correlation structure among the features of available products we conclude that electronic shopping agents through the design of their recommendation algorithms have the potential to influence user preferences in a systematic fashion consumer behavior human decision making influence online shopping personalization persuasion product choice recommendation systems shopping agents user preferences the social web cockpit support for virtual communities this paper describes the design and functionality of the social web cockpit an assistant that supports users while traversing the world wide web the cockpit provides social awareness and supports collaboration notification of interesting web pages collaborative construction of community knowledge and the development of a community vocabulary the cockpit aims at turning the world wide web from an interaction medium into a cooperation tool for the active support and self organization of virtual communities awareness community ware recommender systems shared workspaces knowledge acquisition assisted by clips programming knowledge acquisition is important and machine learning techniques can be used to achieve automated knowledge acquisition this article examines how knowledge acquisition can be assisted by programming using clips an acronym for c language integrated production system a machine learning preprocessor has been developed for the clips environment so that the clips rule base can be expanded by adding rules generated through machine learning techniques the paper also shows how knowledge updating can be supported in the clips environment itself operational engineering knowledge is captured in a data structure called a decision tree and its structure can be updated when new knowledge is acquired in addition some advanced features are also briefly discussed including using cool the clips object oriented language for knowledge acquisition in a software product recommendation system as well as the design of a self evolving knowledge acquisition tool
