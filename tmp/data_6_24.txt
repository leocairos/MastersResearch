strategies for agile software testing automation an industrial experience testing automation has been growing in software engineering many organizations are investing in automated testing in order to prevent defects and increase testing effectiveness during software development in agile methodologies this task is considered an important activity considered the key of the agile testing this paper presents three testing automation strategies applied to three different software projects adopting scrum agile methodology the results indicated positive agile practices to be considered when adopting testing automation strategy such as team collaboration task distribution testing tools knowledge managements the challenges results and lessons learned from this experience are also discussed 2012 ieee agile testing open source testing tools software testing testing automation knowledge management and creativity practices in software engineering an increasing number of organizations are trending to teams for innovation and creativity in software engineering it is the same in the last years the traditional perspective on software development is changing and agile methods have received considerable attention among other attributes the agilists claim that fostering knowledge sharing and creativity is one of the keys to response to common problems and challenges of software development today the development of new software products requires the generation of novel and useful ideas here we fixed some concepts from knowledge management and creativity in relation with new software engineering trends agile methodologies creativity knowledge management software engineering 18th americas conference on information systems 2012 amcis 2012 volume 1 the proceedings contain

knowledge intensive development activities agile teams are cross functional teams that promote sharing of project specific knowledge through frequent face to face interaction effective communication and customer collaboration knowledge sharing is difficult for distributed agile teams due to spatial temporal and cultural barriers which negatively affect face to face interaction communication and collaboration there seems to be very few studies that focus on knowledge management in distributed agile teams through a grounded theory study that involved 45 participants from 28 different software companies in the usa india and australia we investigate distributed software development from the specific perspective of agile teams in this paper we describe how agile teams gather store share and use knowledge in distributed software development 2012 ieee agile methods distributed software development grounded theory knowledge management knowledge sharing proceedings 2012 agile conference

sustainable practice as its second guiding principle agile software development promotes working software over comprehensive documentation in this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development we report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups sad and uml group sad was to update and deliver their high level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by rup templates group uml was instructed to update and deliver their low level software design in form of uml models our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation we found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members consequently this hampered collaboration within the team based in our findings we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product furthermore we argue that codification of internal development knowledge should be a non intrusive task 2012 ieee agile teams knowledge sharing organizational management and coordination process improvement project management software development agile software teams must be creatives an increasing number of organizations are trending to teams for innovation and creativity in software engineering it is the same in the last years the traditional perspective on software development is changing and agile methods have received considerable attention among other attributes the agilists claim that fostering creativity is one of the keys to response to common problems and challenges of software development today the development of new software products requires the generation of novel and useful ideas here we fixed some concepts from knowledge management and creativity in relation with new software engineering trends 2012 ieee agile methodologies creativity extreme programming new products development software development integrated process improvement approach case studies in skype technologies ltd software development organizations find support for rapid changes from agile software development methodologies the agile approaches are also being applied to process improvement to ensure that organizations keep up with the rapidly changing business environment in this paper we present an approach to process improvement that integrates technology oriented strategy agile development methods and knowledge sharing networks and is capable of meeting high resource and schedule constraints the approach was continuously developed over the course of two years in a global technology corporation that experienced 55 revenue and 62 employee growth during that period two organization wide process improvements are discussed as the detailed case studies of this approach the approach enabled a new team to take ownership of new process areas and implement improvements with high employee involvement and empowerment 2012 springer verlag agile methods knowledge sharing networks software process improvement technology orientation application of agile

practice extreme programming in developing management information system also discuss and study the advantages and disadvantages when applying extreme programming in small or middle sized projects with inconstant requirements 2012 ieee agile software development extreme programming website backstage management system knowledge management to support the use of agile methodologies 2012 by knowledge systems institute graduate school there are evidences that the flexibility brought by the agile manifesto has caused problems to the knowledge construction and dissemination as the manifesto doesn t emphasize documentation and record of events and facts knowledge storage and dissemination in general are not performed making its use and recovery too hard the use of processes and mechanisms of knowledge management km are essential for an organization that aims to meet time to market and keep itself competitive in the market this article presents evidence of how the km can be used in a context of agile development knowledge management scrum software development process an agile knowledge discovery in databases software process springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2012 in a knowledge society transforming data into information and knowledge to support the decision making process is a crucial success factor for all organizations in this sense the mission of software engineering is to build systems able to process large volumes of data transform them into relevant knowledge and deliver them to customers so they can make the right decisions at the right time however companies still fail in determining the process model used in their knowledge discovery in databases projects this article introduces the agilekdd an agile and disciplined software process for developing systems capable of discovering the knowledge hidden in databases which was built on top of the open unified process a case study shows that agilekdd can increase the success factor of projects whose goal is to develop knowledge discovery in databases applications agile software development knowledge discovery in databases software process an agile methodology for implementing knowledge management systems a case study in component based software engineering component based software engineering cbse is a knowledge intensive discipline where all activities require the use and the transfer of knowledge between collaborators a better usage transfer and application of this knowledge are required factors to face the challenges of cbse in this perspective knowledge management km aims at setting up knowledge focused processes in the organization knowledge management systems kms are the technological infrastructure supporting these processes in this paper we present a new methodology of kms implementation in a cbse oriented organization we also present a case study of applying this methodology in an existing cbse organization component based software engineering knowledge management knowledge management system current state of reference architectures in the context of agile methodologies software architectures and reference architectures have been playing a significant role in determining the success of software systems in particular reference architectures have emerged achieving well recognized understanding of specific domains promoting reuse of design expertise and facilitating the development of systems in another perspective agile methodologies have been widely adopted as a promising iterative incremental and collaborative software development process including by the software industry considering the relevance of reference architectures initiatives of agile methodologies exploring these architectures are also found however there is a lack of a panorama about the uses impacts and perspectives of such architectures in the agile context the main objective of this paper is present an detailed view about how reference architectures have been used in the context of agile methodologies for this we applied systematic review a technique to systematically explore organize summarize and assess all contributions of a specific research area as main result we have observed that reference architecture and agile methodology should be more investigated together furthermore we intend to contribute to open perspectives of new and important research lines a view towards organizational learning an empirical study on scrum implementation scrum is one of the agile methods gaining more relevance among academics and practitioners it is mainly applied in the context of software development which is a knowledge intensive activity and depends on learning to evolve therefore it becomes crucial to understand the question does scrum implementation trigger a process of organizational learning if yes how does the ol occur this relation has never been established in previous studies the answer to these questions was based on a qualitative research involving key members from uol the most important brazilian company regarding content and services on the internet key members from an academic project and an expert in agile methods implementation among the main findings we highlight that the process of organizational learning could be verified through the individual members learning and through the changes within the organization in management people process and technology beyond the relation established between organizational learning and scrum implementation this study contributes to academic and practical fields by the identification of changes occurred in type of knowledge valued physical structure promotion criteria and individual dependence decrease when implementing scrum it is perceived that knowledge management as a way of perpetuating the learning in the organization is still a challenge for agile software organizations agile software development organizational learning scrum implementation ontology based application model for feature driven development the upcoming technology support for semantic web promises fresh directions for software engineering community also semantic web has its roots in knowledge engineering that provoke software engineers to look for application of ontology applications throughout the software engineering lifecycle the internal components of a semantic web are light weight and may be of less quality standards than the externally visible modules in fact the internal components are generated from external ontological component that s the reason agile development approaches such as feature driven development fdd are suitable for application s internal component development the fdd process is based on its first step of developing the overall model which is build using the information in requirement document and later used for deriving the feature list but there is no particular representation for this model that can be used for checking the quality of model considering such model as a requirement we propose ontology based derivation of overall model that can be used for checking the quality of model and later be used for generation of features from it advantages of ontology based feature driven development are also discussed agile methodology feature driven development ontology an agile scoping process for software product lines the constant changes and the search for new benefits in the software industry make possible the emergence of new research areas in this context a trend that has presented important benefits is the area of agile software product lines software product lines spl and agile methods am both search to satisfy the customer increase quality and decrease time to market and costs the integration between spl and am is a challenge but can increase the benefits that these approaches offer in this sense this paper proposes an agile scoping process for spl scoping software process software product lines neglecting agile principles and practices a case study agile processes are expected to follow a set of well known agile principles and practices this paper analyses the utilization of an agile process in a project that imposes certain difficulties in meeting such principles and practices in their totality particularly those that refer to daily face to face communication among team members and frequent delivery of new versions of the product in short periods of time within a predictable schedule a process based on scrum was adapted to be utilized in a project which had its members distributed in different locations and that required the utilization of emergent technologies not familiar to the developers agile methods agile practices agile

software industry impacting directly on the software system to be produced to deal with this situation software development organizations need to use techniques that enable fast responses agile methods have been considered adequate to handle these situations our research focuses on understanding how brazilian organizations are adopting agile methods in this paper we present the results of an empirical study of refactoring activities which in the organizations we studied are conducted in a collaborative way we call this collaborative refactoring our results suggest that collaborative refactoring promotes knowledge sharing among the development team especially about the software architecture of the system on the other hand we also observed that there is a lack of tools to support collaborative refactoring 2011 springer verlag agile methods brazilian organizations collaboration grounded theory refactoring ten tales of positive change is it possible to make a difference or at

developed to evaluate the advantages and limitations of agile practices in knowledge creation and sharing for agile teams in the first phase initial issues and characteristics concerning agile methodologies were collected with a scoping review of the period since the manifesto for agile software development emerged the second phase represents a hermeneutic analysis of the result set obtained in the first phase using a swot analysis the third phase assesses agile processes their relationships with knowledge transfer management and their effects on the productivity of software

creation knowledge sharing software development teams a knowledge management framework for agile software development teams software development is a knowledge intensive activity and its success depends heavily on the developers knowledge and experience knowledge is considered as the main competitive asset of the organization one of the objectives of knowledge management km is to improve productivity by effective knowledge sharing and transfer agile software development has put a new focus on the question of how to share knowledge among members of software development teams in contrast to heavy weight document centric approaches agile approaches rely on face to face communication for knowledge transfer pair programming is one such practice with the idea to share the work specific knowledge across the development teams through pair rotation this paper introduces work on developing a framework for capturing the tacit knowledge shared among the practitioners of agile software development methodologies this approach facilitates the organizational learning process by capturing and maintaining the necessary knowledge 2011 ieee agile software development knowledge

development as a service sdaas we work with our colleagues to understand their business and pain points and then leverage that knowledge to build an application that at least meets but ideally exceeds their needs in our experience applications built in the mode of software development as a service have the following characteristics there is a single client that owns the program requirements the requirements are not fully formed and the software is at least partly if not completely custom with many decades of software development experience in our group we have used many different techniques for conducting software projects in sdaas the style of interaction between the client team and the development team is a natural fit for agile software development methods although our conditions do not fit the ideal agile software development project profile we have consistently experienced significant gains from taking the approach of iterative and incremental development we have used the waterfall or plan based method many times for past projects and we have consistently paid a significant price for the big design up front problems that go with that type of schedule although agile methods have consistently outperformed other methods in the early stages of a project they do less well as the application program grows and the project matures once an application is in production and has an established user base the emphasis of the client and development teams change from fast easy and elegant feature additions to stability release planning and maintenance the imposition of a fixed schedule naturally transitions the overall project management into a plan based model however we came to realize that agile methods still play an essential role even when the overall project has matured to a steady state and is managed in a planbased fashion when developing a new program requirement unless it is completely understood i e all aspects and expected results documented then it must go through an agile prototyping phase in order for it to be properly developed and scheduled that agile prototyping phase is still bound inside a plan based schedule but that leaves room for iteration and innovation that we would not otherwise have in a fixed schedule in this paper we examine the various forces that influence both the client and development organizations that are engaged in software development as a service using several projects from our past as examples we show that the level of program technology and requirement understanding determines which development method will be more successful plan based methods will work if all aspects of the project are known and there are minimal variables otherwise our experience shows that an agile development model is likely to be the best choice for the beginning of a project once a project reaches steady state with production releases then a hybrid model works best where agile methods are used to prototype new features but bounded inside of a plan based schedule 2011 ieee agile development hybrid development plan based development an approach to sharing business process models in agile style global software engineering the globalization of information technology and the improvement of telecommunication facilities have facilitated software development business processes worldwide despite this increasingly popular trend the initial expectations of the cost reductions of offshore outsourcing have not been realized many software development companies are facing difficulties caused by many hidden costs including translation efforts in language gap transition risks learning needs communication overheads setup times ramping up durations scope creeps etc in this paper we propose an approach to improving knowledge sharing in global software development in addition the trend of software development methodology has been changing to iterative and agile style from the classic waterfall model in iterative and agile software developments requirement specification coding testing are mainly interested in a relatively short term the rationale of this change came from the higher software quality and higher customer satisfaction iterative process can involve customers and developers into its software development mode carefully and deeply one of the challenges is to apply an iterative or agile development model into global software developments the main problem is such iterative and agile process might need the tremendous number of communications and documents for collaboration because of iteration

the extensive application of management information system mis and the popularity of agile software development methodologies have rendered the whole software industry new opportunities where nonetheless endless challenges are shadowed on one hand the huge demand for mis and the ability of fast delivery possessed by agile software development and its flexible handling of the variation of requirements have fostered an extremely promising market on the other hand with the contemporary software development technology developers are repeatedly implementing those generic functionalities spread extensively in all mis including the creation retrieval updating and deletion of the data in this thesis a seminal development pattern for mis is explored namely to completely define the generic behaviors and functionalities through external xml description which is combined with the most promising technologies at the age of agile software development namely the scala programming language and the lift web application framework in establishing a mis oriented application framework it extracts the generic functionalities of mis from specific business logic enabling agile software development methodologies to be better applied which further satisfies the demand of the market and resolves the problems within it 2010 ieee agile lift scala transition from a plan driven process to scrum a longitudinal case study on software quality although scrum is an important topic in software engineering and information systems few longitudinal industrial studies have investigated the effects of scrum on software quality in terms of defects and defect density and the quality assurance process in this paper we report on a longitudinal study in which we have followed a project over a three year period we compared software quality assurance processes and software defects of the project between a 17 month phase with a plan driven process followed by a 20 month phase with scrum the results of the study did not show a significant reduction of defect densities or changes of defect profiles after scrum was used however the iterative nature of scrum resulted in constant system and acceptance testing and related defect fixing which made the development process more efficient in terms of fewer surprises and better control of software quality and release date in addition software quality and knowledge sharing got more focus when using scrum however scrum put more stress and time pressure on the developers and made them reluctant to perform certain tasks for later maintenance such as refactoring 2010 acm agile software development empirical software engineering software quality perceived productivity threats in large agile development projects applying agile methodology in large software development projects introduces many challenges for example one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts and one may expect that agile s informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases such issues may in turn compromise the project s productivity in order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity the project was a large software development project consisting of 11 scrum teams from three different subcontractors the repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas 1 restraints on collaboration due to contracts ownership and culture 2 architectural and technical qualities are given low priority 3 conflicts between organizational control and flexibility 4 volatile and late requirements from external parties 5 lack of a shared vision for the end product 6 limited dissemination of functional knowledge 7 excessive dependencies within the system 8 overloading of key personnel 9 difficulties in maintaining well functioning technical environments 10 difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties using critical case reasoning we claim that projects deploying agile practices in projects with less favorable conditions than those enjoyed in the current project and that are larger and more complex are likely to face similar challenges 2010 acm agile case study large development projects practitioners mental models repertory grid measuring effectiveness of hci integration in software development processes integrating human computer interaction hci activities in software engineering se processes is an often expressed desire two metrics to demonstrate the impact of integrating hci activities in se processes are proposed usability goals achievement metric ugam is a product metric that measures the extent to which the design of a product achieves its user experience goals index of integration ioi is a process metric that measures the extent of integration of the hci activities in the se process both the metrics have an organizational perspective and can be applied to a wide range of products and projects an attempt has been made to keep the metrics easy to use in the industrial context while the two metrics were proposed mainly to establish a correlation between the two and thereby demonstrate the effectiveness of integration of hci in se processes several other applications seem likely the two metrics were evaluated in three independent studies a classroom based evaluation with two groups of students a qualitative feedback from three industry projects and a quantitative evaluation using 61 industry projects the metrics were found to be useful easy to use and helpful in making the process more systematic our studies showed that the two metrics correlate well with each other and that ioi is a good predictor of ugam regression analysis showed that ioi has a somewhat greater effect on ugam in projects that use the agile process model than the waterfall process and in the projects that are executed as a contracted software development service than in the projects in product companies ugam also correlated well with the traditional usability evaluations 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved hci se integration metrics usability goals a decision support system utilizing a semantic agent the adaptabilty rapidity and focus on high quality solutions offered by agile methodology have lead to a paradigm shift in the software development process in many enterprises agile methodology is iterative in nature with each iteration i e timebox lasting 2 6 weeks iterations involve small teams comprising 9 19 developers working through the entire software development life cycle agile methodology works on two basic principles the first being regular adaptation to changing circumstances and the second focus on technical excellence and good design and high quality code the first principle accommodates that tasks in an agile project cannot be predicted more than a week in advance thus the need arises for project teams to incorporate experts in the problem domain such that they are better equipped to handle changes rapidly however this methodology has been criticised as it may not bring about the benefits intended by the second principle unless practised by skilled programmers who can create high quality code hence a project manager should be equipped with a highly skilled team we propose the utilization of a semantic agent 4 which will act on behalf of the project manager and suggest experts based on a set of parameters our semantic agent is based on a semantic matching algorithm 7 this algorithm utilizes an ontology based similarity framework to make recommendations and suggest training paths to satisfy the requirements of the project manager the agent uses this algorithm to recommend employees based on their expertise past experience and availability further based on recommendations made by the agent we classify employees as experts and non experts and suggest knowledge transfer 8 methods to upgrade their skills 2010

projects purpose agile software development asd is currently an emerging approach in software engineering for improving quality initially advocated by a group of 17 software professionals who practice a set of lightweight methods and share a common set of values of software development owing to the attractive claims of successes of the asd approach many traditional projects which used to practice plan driven software development are gradually transitioning into asd based development this paper seeks to report the results from a survey based ex post facto study aimed at determining the relative importance if any of the changes traditional plan driven software development projects have to undergo to adopt asd practices design methodology approach the study was conducted using a web based survey with asd practitioners who had experience of practicing plan driven software development in the past asd practitioners from a wide range of industrial sectors participated in the study similarly the study is not restricted to any specific organisation project size culture or nationality the respondents were widely geographically distributed across continents findings the study received 241 responses of which 165 were usable the study did not reveal any substantial difference in importance of the four classes of changes hypothesised changes in culture changes in management style changes in knowledge management strategy and changes in development processes the authors believe that this is an important finding because it is indicative of not isolating one class of changes from another in practical transition exercises however another noteworthy observation was that transitioning from heavily process centric to short iterative test driven and people centric development was considered by the largest percentage roughly 77 per cent of respondents to be very important the open ended questions in the study also revealed three additional classes of changes changes in personal characteristics changes in customer attitude and changes in knowledge and education of stakeholders originality value in this work an attempt was made to gain an understanding of the relative importance of the different critical changes that would be helpful to a project manager who is involved in the transition from traditional plan driven software development practices to agile software

in the rise reuse in software engineering project enables and supports the design of human centered knowledge sharing platforms such as wikis furthermore the paper specifes requirements one should keep in mind when building human centered systems to support knowledge management a two phase qualitative analysis showed that the knowledge management system acts as a fexible and customizable view

2009 springer verlag agile methodologies creativity extreme programming knowledge management software development knowledge management issues in teaching extreme programming extreme programming focuses on spreading knowledge through many collaborative practices like pair programming planning game and retrospectives the basic idea behind these practices is to share the work specific knowledge

of a recently conducted online survey regarding the current state of the integration of agile methods and usability ucd a world wide response of 92 practitioners was received the results show that the majority of practitioners perceive that the integration of agile methods with usability ucd has added value to their adopted processes and to their teams has resulted in the improvement of usability

and managers that a document driven development process is incompatible with an agile development process there are few reports on this issue and even less empirical research documenting the assumed incompatibility more and more software companies however have a desire to adopt agile development processes while maintaining compliance with a quality assurance standard or even a process standard we have studied the software development process of a danish pharmaceutical company for market reasons the company has to comply the us food and drug administration s standards for software development the company has also successfully implemented significant parts of the agile methodology scrum we describe this case and we analyse using soft systems methodology how well the development process combines these diverging sets of process requirements we find that despite much effort the agile development process suffers from its adaptation to the fda standard but at the same time many of the genuine qualities of an agile process have been maintained from this case study we discuss the implications for development companies facing the challenge of implementing a mixed development approach

they are now common for many systems development projects literature stresses the importance of organizational culture for agile development but only little empirical research about their relationship has been conducted on this background we carried out a cultural analysis in 3 organizations which perform systems and software development according to agile principles we found that agile development thrives in different organizational cultures as long as the 4 core values are present to a significant extent this is possible because agile methods bear to compromise even with central elements of the agile approach this is the essence of agility 2009 kautz pedersen monrad agile software development organizational culture investigating agile user centered design in practice a grounded theory

qualitative approach to determine what is happening in actual practice the data was collected by semi structured interviews with professionals who have already worked with an integrated agile ucd methodology further data was collected by observing these professionals in their working context and by studying their documents where possible the emerging themes that the study found show that there is an increasing realization of the importance of usability in software development among agile team members the requirements are emerging and both low and high fidelity prototypes based usability

2009 agile methods extreme programming grounded theory interviews scrum usability user centered design understanding agility in software development from a complex adaptive systems perspective agile software development methods have emerged in recent years and have become increasingly popular since the start of the century while much research claims to study agile methods the meaning of agility itself in software development is yet to be fully understood agility is viewed by some as the antithesis of plan structure discipline and bureaucracy this study aims to develop a better understanding of agility using the key concepts of complex adaptive systems as a theoretical lens the study explores agility from several different angles including autonomous team stability and uncertainty and team learning a multiple case study research method was employed the findings of the study emphasize that agility is manifested as stability and discipline which are just as desirable as flexibility and context sharing is of the same value and importance as knowledge sharing in addition the collective nature of learning is underlined agility autonomy complex adaptive systems stability team learning simulation in software engineering with system dynamics a case study there are many complexities including dynamic behavior and feedback mechanism as well as various interacting factors in the practical software development software engineering education is facing difficulties because students have limited engineering experience and they can hardly understand typical phenomena occurring in software projects system dynamics is a continuous modeling method describing the interaction between project factors it forces one to consider system behavior in global view the simulation models encapsulate collective knowledge of software engineering fields they support the training that the students can interact with to practice project control which will help students understand the key factors and behaviors in complex scenarios in this paper brooks law and the effects of pair programming in extreme programming xp were used as case study to demonstrate the basic concepts analysis and modeling processes of system dynamics the simulation results show the advantages of the approach finally the uses of system dynamics approach in critical areas of software engineering are presented

knowledge management in practice the case of agile software development knowledge is considered as the main competitive asset of the organization one of the knowledge management km cornerstones is improving productivity by effective knowledge sharing and transfer however from the game theory perspective the main constraint is that people tend not to collaborate in uncertainty conditions when collaborative behavior is not guaranteed and sharing knowledge is time and effort consuming therefore km must be a practical aspect of the general organizational culture specifically software development is a knowledge intensive activity and its success depends heavily on the developers knowledge and experience in this presentation we highlight how the agile approach initiates a culture

how facilitating knowledge management and putting the customer in the drivers seat enables sound architectural design within the field of software engineering emergence of agile methods has been a hot topic since the late 90s extreme programming xp 1 was one of the first agile methods and is one of the most well known however research has pointed to weaknesses in xp regarding supporting development of viable architectures to strengthen xp in this regard a new practice developer stories 2 was introduced in 2006 mainly based on a theoretical argumentation this paper reports from extensive experimentation with and elaboration of the new practice results from this experimentation shows that using developer stories increases the likelihood of developing a viable architecture through a series of deliberate choices through creating disciplined and recurring activities that 1 facilitate sharing and embodying of knowledge about architectural issues and 2 heighten visibility of refactorings for both customers and developers 2008 springer verlag agile user centered design applied to a mobile multimedia streaming application mobile computing is leading a revolution multimedia consumption on mobile devices is increasing day by day the most important factor for the success of such applications is user acceptance additionally the success of a software development project is associated not only with tools and technologies but also depends on how much the development process is both user centered and developer oriented we are working on a project to develop a multimedia streaming application for mobile phones the paper describes our adopted development process the integration of extreme programming xp one of the popular agile methods with user centered design ucd and shows how the integrated process facilitates user orientation and at the same time preserves the social values of the development team the paper also presents a summary of a recently carried out usability study 2008 springer berlin heidelberg agile methods extreme programming mobile application usability user centered design a qualitative assessment of the reverse engineering capabilities of unit testing tools for understanding java programs the rise of agile methodologies and open source software has led to the creation of several new tools designed to help software engineers construct better applications one particular emphasis of these new tools is the creation of unit tests this paper describes a qualitative assessment of the reverse engineering capabilities of three unit testing tools agitar software s agitator and the open source tools junit and easymock for java programs the focus of the assessment is largely on how the unit testing tools can assist in understanding existing code the assessment is structured using an existing reverse engineering environment framework reef the results of the assessment suggest that unit testing tools can indeed aid software engineers in understanding java programs assessment java program understanding qualitative reef reverse engineering unit testing design issues for knowledge artifacts the notion of knowledge artifact has rapidly gained popularity in the fields of general knowledge management and more recently knowledge based systems the main goal on this paper is to propose and discuss a methodology for the design and implementation of knowledge based systems founded on knowledge artifacts we advocate that the systems built according to this methodology can be effective to convey the flow of knowledge between different communities of practice our methodology has been developed from the ground up i e we have built some concrete systems based on the abstract notion of knowledge artifact and synthesized our methodology based on reflections upon our experiences building these systems in this paper we also describe the most relevant systems we have built and how they have guided us to the synthesis of our

actual use and usefulness of extreme programming and scrum press releases scientific publications and anecdotal evidence demonstrate that organisations worldwide are adopting agile software development methods at increasing speed little is still known about the current usefulness of agile methods in the complex environment of the embedded software development industry embedded devices are already commonplace in regular households the goal of this survey is to provide first hand knowledge of the adoption and experience of two of the most known agile methods namely extreme programming and scrum in a number of european organisations of embedded software known to be interested and active in experimenting with agile software development methods the survey involved 13 industrial organisations in eight european countries and 35 individual software development projects the focus of the questionnaire was to enquire into the level of use as well as the experienced usefulness or expected usefulness if there was no experience available of the two agile methods and their individual practices the results show that the embedded industry has been able to apply agile

pair development an approach in which a pair of developers jointly work on the same piece of code solo development and mixed development under two separate objectives effort minimization and time minimization to this end we develop analytical models to optimize module developer assignments in each of these approaches these models are shown to be strongly np hard and solved using a genetic algorithm the solo and pair development approaches are compared for a variety of problem instances to highlight project characteristics that favor one of the two practices we also propose a simple criterion that can reliably recommend the appropriate approach for a given problem instance typically for efficient knowledge sharing between developers or for highly connected systems the pair programming approach is preferable also the pair approach is better at leveraging expertise by pairing experts with less skilled partners solo programming is usually desirable if the system is large or the effort needed either to form a pair or to code efficiently in pairs is high solo programming is also appropriate for projects with a tight deadline whereas the reverse is true for projects with a lenient deadline the mixed approach i e an approach where both the solo and pair practices are used in the same project is only indicated when the system consists of groups of modules that are sufficiently different from one another 2008 informs extreme programming genetic algorithms heuristics integer programming pair programming software development methodology knowledge conversion in software development software processes can be categorized in two types of approach engineering based processes criticized for restraining creativity and agile methodologies criticized for being often unpredictable this paper proposes a conciliatory view of software processes by analysing human cognitive activities our approach based on the seci knowledge conversion process defines eight knowledge conversion types the approach is then tested on a project developed by a team of undergraduate students enrolled in a capstone project during the 2006 winter semester at école polytechnique de

those methods tries to promote rapid development with no loss of efficiency while keeping client and user satisfaction by applying its own set of agile principles and practices deciding which method to adopt for a given reality is a complicated matter and sometimes it may be necessary to combine practices from different methods to better approach the problem this paper presents a framework containing the agile practices adopted by several agile methods and interdependencies between such practices as a basis for comparing and selecting which practices should be part of the software process a tool for defining new software processes based on this framework is also presented besides helping managing the selected practices and respective interdependencies this tool also allows

this high level tutorial gives an overview of agile methods and provides background to understand how agile teams are trying to address modem software development challenges analysis of initial empirical evidence is used to discuss strengths and limitations of agile methods in various contexts the participants are introduced to the innovation diffusion models and environments and discuss what is needed for agile methods to cross the chasm and move into the mainstream of software development agile methods agile project management extreme programming innovation diffusion knowledge sharing lean quality assurance scrum coordination in agile software projects agile methodologies have been widely adopted by various projects though different practices are recommended by different methodologies they all share some common key characteristics these characteristics call for more effective coordination within development teams in this research we investigate the coordination mechanisms used in agile software development and the factors that impact their effectiveness we differentiate coordination mechanisms as vertical coordination and horizontal coordination we argue that vertical coordination and horizontal coordination are positively associated with the success of agile projects the relationship between vertical coordination and the success of agile project is moderated by project size explicit knowledge representation can positively influence vertical coordination sharing locus of practices can increase collective identity both of which can positively influence horizontal coordination agile methodology coordination horizontal coordination vertical coordination managing uncertainty in agile release planning a clear and realistic release plan is central to the strategic planning activities of the firm developing the software this paper supports existing agile methods by developing a novel but relatively simple statistical methodology to predict the time to develop selected functionality in so doing it provides the product owner with a decision support mechanism to determine the likelihood of completing releases on time for any combination of stories in this way it is consistent with the best extreme programming xp practice of selecting stories of two types for a quarterly release ones that are key and must be delivered and ones that are considered as slack and that can be developed if time permits a case study is used to explain the proposed methodology analysis of the interaction between practices for introducing xp

group inc after the scrum twenty years of working without documentation agile processes enable software development projects to react to rapid changes in the development environment however they are often criticized for not creating and maintaining standard documentation such as requirements and design documentation the lack of documentation can be detrimental for maintaining knowledge especially in the long run because there is no explicit medium for communication to new people and among existing developers this poses an important question whether the use of agile processes in long run is feasible in this paper we presented a field study of an organization that has been using an agile process for more than 20 years and has been successful in maintaining knowledge over that period instead of written documentation they use living documents well connected communication and working software are prioritized as mediums for maintaining knowledge however success is not easily achieved there are important factors that enable the organization to use the current practices successfully these factors are shared values overlapping knowledge among team members low turnover rate and well understood requirements contextualizing knowledge management readiness to support change management strategies research on knowledge management km readiness has matured however recent organizational structures have emerged which prevent traditional instruments from adequately measuring km readiness in an organization for example service oriented enterprise soe structure and agile software development techniques are characterized by multiple groups working together with each performing services as part of project pattern or process each group acts in its own role as a sub organization with its unique helping patterns and cultures 17 traditional instruments which measure aggregate constructs across the entire organization will miss important between group differences in an soe that might influence km readiness this paper presents a case based field study from a large fortune 500 financial firm transitioning its structure to soe and considering agile software development methodologies survey data was collected along with a series of interviews with key managers and developers findings indicate statistically significant differences in km readiness between groups and the need for alignment 2006 ieee can distributed software development be agile software development organizations are striving to blend agile software development methods such as extreme programming

evolutionary theory of knowledge metaphysics and the open society that the agile approach to software development is strongly endorsed by popper s philosophy of critical rationalism in the final section the relevance of christopher alexander s ideas to agile methodologies and their similarity to popper s philosophy is demonstrated springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2006 knowledge management in different software development approaches in this paper we present some ideas concepts and experiences related with our work of implementing solvers to combinatorial optimization problems we have been designing implementing and using solvers for important kind of problems and painfully the process of developing them is not optimal at all the most used practice which is based on trial and error often incurs an enormous amount of resources clearly this is a software engineering problem then to find better ways of developing optimization algorithms solvers and metaheuristics is our interest too the software development community has a wide spectrum of methodologies when it decides to implement a software project from the more traditional tayloristic practices to agile methods software development is a knowledge intensive activity and the knowledge creation and sharing are crucial parts of the software development processes this paper presents a comparative analysis between knowledge sharing approaches of agile and tayloristic software development teams sprinkled with concerns about the development of metaheuristics springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2006 agile development knowledge management knowledge sharing metaheuristics optimization algorithms reusability organization theoretic perspective for simulation modeling of agile software processes software development is a team effort that requires cooperation among individuals via task allocation coordination of actions and if necessary avoidance and or management of conflicts among members of the organization this perspective contrasts with the production focused view of software development that is interaction becomes the central activity not a side effect of a method s prescription understanding the principles and components of organizational behavior for inclusion in software process models improves the level of fidelity and credibility of existing process simulations furthermore there are strong connections between the neo information processing view of organizations and agile software development this paper introduces the conceptual basis for an agent based

interaction agility in practice one of the stated beliefs common to practitioners of all the agile methodologies is that the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation this view is pervasive throughout agile systems techniques and approaches there is starting to be some interest and in depth investigation into the nature of programmer interaction and dialogue within the case of pair programming 2 as well as larger scale ethnographic studies of xp practice 10 although interesting metaphoric features have already been found in the language of expert software developers 12 8 7 more detailed qualitative analysis can also be made into the nature of such communication narrative analysis 9 is an in depth qualitative analysis methodology and focuses on the ways in which people make and use stories to interpret the world storytelling and its role for communicating social tacit knowledge and historical and organisational identity is well recognised 4 so far there are fairly few cases where narrative analysis has been applied to information systems an analysis of these are given in wagner 11 but it is beginning to find popularity within the information systems community as it has proved particularly useful when considering tacit knowledge transfer and related communication issues especially during periods of organisational change 1 5 narratives are considered to be social products within specific contexts and an interpretive device through which people communicate knowledge and define their own identity it is arguable that the most basic and prevalent form of narrative arises as the product of ordinary conversation 6 as gregori signes 3 points out we tell stories to each other as a means of packaging experience in cognitively and effectively coherent ways or as a way to test the borderlines between the exceptional and the ordinary conversational stories are negotiable and collaboratively developed between more than one speaker although one speaker usually has a predominant role a pilot study incorporating narrative interviews supported by observational data of a small software development company in the south of england has recently been conducted preliminary analysis supports the view that this qualitative technique when further applied to the community of agile systems developers will provide potentially interesting results springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2006 extreme programming promotes extreme learning extreme programming xp is an agile methodology claimed to promote the rapid development of software systems enabling the accommodation of changing customer requirements during the project lifecycle without excessive cost penalties the mechanisms used to achieve this require the software development team to maintain accurate tacit knowledge through extensive face to face communication and peer learning this characteristic of xp the authors argue makes it a suitable tool in the teaching of new technologies to software engineering students this is borne out by feedback from a group of fourth year master of engineering meng software engineering undergraduate students who undertook an xp based project as part of their course furthermore the authors argue that the methodology is best taught in its full form through group project

adaptive and allow knowledge transfer researchers in the area of knowledge management claimed that the knowledge creation process software developers build towards a specific mode will lead to its adoption this paper attempts to integrate knowledge creation as a condition of adoption this paper reports on how a canadian organization shifts its development method from the waterfall process to extreme programming model the findings show that the differences outweigh the similarities and caution needs to be exercised in adopting either one of two models knowledge creation indeed plays an important role in adopting extreme programming model the implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners are discussed extreme programming knowledge creation systems adoption the knowledge management strategy of agile software development in software development the most important asset is knowledge much of this knowledge is tacit and given its elusive nature this creates a challenge for organisations in practice most organisational km strategies are codification strategies or personalisation strategies we use this distinction to guide a review of typical practices in agile software development that address knowledge management based on this survey we conclude that agile software development implies a personalisation strategy codification knowledge management personalisation strategy automatic requirements elicitation in agile processes one of the generic phases of software engineering is the requirements analysis this paper presents a new method for automatically retrieving functional requirements from the stakeholders using agile processes the presented system is a machine learning system for the automation of some aspects of the software requirements phase in the software engineering process this learning system encompasses knowledge acquisition and belief revision in a knowledge base it is based on tecuci s multi strategy task adaptive learning by justification trees algorithm known as disciple mtl and supports a few of the practices that extreme programming xp requires the aim of the algorithm is to collect information from the various stakeholders and integrate a variety of learning methods in the knowledge acquisition process while involving certain and plausible reasoning the result of the manipulation is a list of requirements essential to a software system effective elements of integrated software development process supported platform modern software development puts much emphasis on unified and standard software development processes such as rup rational unified process tsp team software process psp personal software process and xp extreme programming in order to support these standard processes this paper proposes a software development process supported platform that takes workflow engine as its core and contains a number of effective elements such configuration management knowledge management and agent assisted personal software process based on this integrated platform the development process of software organizations can be fully automatically controlled with high performance springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2005 collaborative knowledge acquisition for agile project management recently potential of agile management has been successfully proven in several different application domains particularly in software development in this paper we propose process model for application of the agile methodologies to project management in general in order to address the aspect of interaction we discuss few collaborative computing mechanisms that may be adopted in intelligent information systems enabling knowledge acquisition for agile project management and further investigate qualitative benefits of the approach the mechanisms are illustrated by means of our collaborative semantic web portal prototype 2005 ieee agile management collaborative computing mechanisms intelligent information systems project management stretching agile to fit cmmi level 3 the story of creating msf for cmmi process improvement at microsoft corporation agile practitioners pride themselves on highly productive responsive low ceremony lightweight tacit knowledge processes with little waste adaptive planning and frequent iterative delivery of value it is often assumed that cmmi compliant processes need to be heavyweight bureaucratic slow moving high ceremony and plan driven agile developers often skeptically perceive formal process improvement initiatives as management generated inefficiency that gets in the way of productivity at microsoft we ve adopted the teachings of w edwards deming and stretched our msf for agile software development method to fit the requirements for cmmi level 3 the resultant msf for cmmi process improvement is a highly iterative adaptive planning method light on documentation and heavily automated through tooling it enables management and organization of software engineering through use of agile metrics such as velocity and cumulative flow but with an added dimension of an understanding of variation adapted from deming s teachings this is the story of how mixing deming with agile produced a lightweight cmmi solution for net developers everywhere 2005 ieee human and social factors of software engineering from its initial days in the sixties and seventies the field of software engineering has to a large extent been concerned with the technological aspects of software as well as the formal procedures to be followed and artifacts to be produced in order to create high quality software however for some years we have seen a growing awareness that software engineering is a process involving humans with all their particularities working together in a social context software projects rarely fail because of technical issues their often fail because of human and communication problems psychological and sociological perspectives and theories have been used in order to understand concerns that may cause problems in the process of constructing and maintaining software and further to develop means to cope with these issues in particular among agile software development approaches we have seen new and inventive approaches to solve some of the issues relating to behavior group interaction and society to make the social and human factors of software engineering more explicit we aim among others to focus on psychological aspects of software developers and on the communication among software developers between developers and users and other actors and stakeholders related to the software process the formation of the social environment of the software developers as well as its impact on productivity of the developments process and the quality of software is another pertinent issue another perspective is the role technological tools play in the construction of the social environment in which software engineers work thus including and combining approaches of software engineering with theories of cognitive science psychology and social science the workshop will try to systematize the relevant factors establishing a common ground for further studies on the topic in particular the workshop looks at software engineering from the perspectives of agile methods and communication theory in order to point out solutions and conditions for human centered software engineering processes typical topics to be investigated are practices for knowledge dissemination in software engineering teams knowledge reuse in software engineering projects interactions in software development processes social software approaches decision making processes in software development and communication architectures for human centric collaboration support of developer teams in more general terms we aim to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the latest developments in the areas of cognitive social science approaches to software development problems knowledge engineering and software engineering approaches and how these interact to create a human centered software development process communication architectures decision support human centric collaboration support interaction theory knowledge dissemination and reuse social software software

methods engineering and development and quality and knowledge concepts springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2005 a project growth model based on communication for software development the new trend of software development such as agile software development has difficulty in the conventional document based management the executable software is higher priority than development documents such as detaildesign documents and detail bug reports if managers depend on the development reports in order to grasp the project progress and product quality the managers will miss the chance of grasping the progress and the quality in agile software development therefore we proposed a project growth model for grasping project state without development documents the model is based on the conventional software reliability growth models the parameters about bugs is replaced to the parameters of communication topic the concept and the procedure of the model is the same as the software reliability growth model as a result of applying the model to open source projects a significant change of project state was able to be detected by the project growth model without development documents tool support for inter team learning in agile software organizations the need for organizational learning support is common among all software development companies but is not addressed by agile software methods practitioners the typical experience factory approach to address organizational learning in software companies often stresses structured and explicit knowledge as well as controlled learning mechanisms in contrast the communities of practice approach relies more on tacit knowledge and self organization to bridge the gap between these two conflicting approaches this paper proposes a suite of lightweight knowledge sharing tools by which software organizations are given the flexibility to control how structured and controlled their learning processes are initial results from early evaluations of the proposed tools are also given springer verlag 2004 proceedings of the agile development conference adc 2004 the proceedings contain 18 papers from the proceedings of the agile development conference adc 2004 the topics discussed include agile methods for large organizations building communities of practice an initial exploration of the relationship between pair programming and brook law exploring extreme programming in context an industrial case study the xp customer role in practice three studies a study evolution of co location and planning strategy decision space infrastructure agile development in a large distributed team refactoring the development process experiences with the incremental adoption of agile practices and using competition to build a stronger team direct verbal communication as a catalyst of agile knowledge sharing this paper discusses the role of conversation and social interactions as the key element of effective knowledge sharing in an agile process it also presents the observations made during a repeated experiment on knowledge sharing conducted in various groups of professionals and students the study suggests that the focus on the pure codified approach is the critical reason of tayloristic team failure to effectively share knowledge among all stakeholders of a software project drawing on the knowledge as relationship perspective of knowledge sharing we theorize that verbal face to face interaction facilitates achieving higher velocity by software development teams 2004 ieee agile methods conversation knowledge sharing social interaction verbal communication extreme programming pair programmers team players or future leaders this paper will establish that a productive working relationship can be enhanced in an extreme programming xp pair programming team if team members here were to develop and improve their own individual emotional intelligence ei persona a conceptual model armes was developed for personal traits identified for pair programmers the validity of this armes model for pair programming was tested against two previously published xp case studies finally implications of the conclusions were discussed along with suggested areas of future research software development software engineering software methodology agile methods for large organizations building communities of practice agile development practices respect tacit knowledge make communication more effective and thus foster the knowledge creation process however the current agile methods like xp are focused on practices that individual teams or projects need and the use of the methods in organizations consisting of multiple cooperating teams is difficult the community of practice theory suggests that large agile organizations should have various over lapping informal cross team communities this paper studies three agile methods developed at nokia that use facilitated workshops to solve multi team issues the paper explains using communities of practices theory why these methods work in multi team settings the results of this paper suggest that workshop practices that amass people from different parts of organizations to perform a specific well defined task can be used effectively to solve issues that span over multiple teams and to build up communities of practice this result suggests that the community of practice concept could provide a basis for adapting agile methods for the needs of large organizations 2004 ieee agile methods applied to embedded firmware development this paper describes the experience of applying agile approaches to the development of firmware for the intel itanium processor family embedded development i e firmware projects are quite different from object oriented and pure software endeavors yet they face many of the same challenges that agile software development practices address several unique challenges are described including team members specialized domain knowledge technical backgrounds and attitudes toward change and the impact hardware plays in firmware design we found agile approaches to be well suited for our project despite the fact that most agile methodologists come from very different backgrounds 2004 ieee knowledge sharing in agile software teams traditionally software development teams follow tayloristic approaches favoring division of labor and hence the use of role based teams role based teams require the transfer of knowledge from one stage of the development process to the next as multiple stages are involved the problem of miscommunication due to indirect and long communication path is amplified agile development teams address this problem by using cross functional teams that encourages direct communication and reduces the likelihood of miscommunication agile approaches usually require team members to be co located and only facilitate intra team learning to overcome the restriction in colocation and support organizational inter team learning while supporting the social context critical to the sharing of tacit knowledge is the focus of this paper we also highlight that humans are good at making sense of incomplete and approximative information springer verlag 2004 extreme programming in reducing the rework of requirement change requirement changes and the involved rework are inevitable if the requirement change could not be foreseen extreme programming xp suggests customer to be on site with the developers the requirement changes may be forecasted by the on site customer from the business perspective and by the developers from the technology perspective extreme programming was adopted in lattice trading system reengineering project the user stories were weighed by a set of criteria which included the risk cost schedule as well as the possibility to be changed the stories were decomposed into features and the features were organized into components the components with less possibility to be changed were implemented earlier meanwhile spikes were conducted when the decisions were being made for some critical tasks in such a way most components were completed without any change to their functional features while few components were implemented with large modification the overall effort of rework was reduced considerably with this approach compared with the small cost for managing the change possibility the method introduced in this paper is of significant worth extreme programming project management requirement change user story teaching for understanding and its specialization to software engineering learning outcomes may be expressed as a set of items to be addressed and corresponding performance levels to be reached for each item engineering involves the capability to perform engineering functions so it is desirable that learning outcomes address engineering performance there are several frameworks for defining education levels this paper briefly summarizes the dimensions and understanding frameworks that were developed by one of the branches of the teaching for understanding school of educational thought a few examples of specializing the dimensions and understanding frameworks to software engineering education are presented the dimensions framework is compared with a set of levels from an agile process source which also addresses software engineering performance the dimensions and understanding frameworks appear to apply well to software engineering from cards to code how extreme programming re embodies programming as a collective practice this paper discusses extreme programming xp a relatively new and increasingly popular user centred software design approach extreme programming proposes that collaborative software development should be centred on the practices of programming that proposal contrasts strongly with more heavily instrumented formalised and centrally managed software engineering methodologies the paper maps the interactions of an extreme programming team involved in building a commercial organisational knowledge management system using ethnographic techniques it analyses how this particular style of software development developed in a given locality and how it uniquely hybridised documents conversations software tools and office layout in that locality it examines some of the many artifices devices techniques and talk that come together as a complicated contemporary software system is produced it argues that xp s emphasis on programming as the core activity and governing metaphor can only be understood in relation to competing overtly formal software engineering approaches and the organisational framing of software development xp it suggests gains traction by re embodying the habits of programming as a collective practice co ordination work ethnography extreme programming software development techniques user centred design the agile teaching learning methodology and its e learning platform the agile teaching learning methodology atlm is a teaching learning methodology designed for higher education based on the best practices and ideas from the field of software engineering and leveraging upon concepts from agile software methodologies although atlm was designed using concepts borrowed from software engineering the methodology itself can easily be applied to a wide variety of courses that might require agility in teaching and learning this paper explains the objectives behind atlm and the process architecture of the methodology atlm emphasizes agility communication and the learning process the paper also presents the e learning platform we have developed to support this atlm approach to teaching learning and the technologies behind this platform the atlm e learning platform makes use of a number of modern collaboration and knowledge sharing technologies such as blogging commenting instant messaging wiki and xml rss springer verlag 2004 e learning platform learning methodology teaching methodology extending agile methods postmortem reviews as extended feedback agile software development methods such as extreme programming focus on informal learning mechanisms like pair programming yet powerful methods new knowledge that is gained in a project will not spread rapidly in an organisation if knowledge and experience is not externalised we propose to combine a lightweight externalisation method postmortem reviews with agile methods to strengthen the overall learning and suggest how this can be done we use practical experience from an extreme programming development project and from conducting postmortem analysis in several companies in our discussion springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2003 agile development methods experience elicitation extreme programming knowledge management postmortem reviews digging into the fundamentals of extreme programming building the theoretical base for agile methods extreme programming xp is an accepted and widely used agile software development method with active user communities worldwide there exists a great deal of anecdotal evidence to support the use of xp in different situations while some empirical evidence regarding the use of a certain composite of xp practices exist no scientifically grounded theory exists based on the notion that software engineering is knowledge intensive work we show that generic knowledge management theories can be used to explain how xp practices improve an organization s agility tuomi s i tuomi 999 model for knowledge creation is used to explain the different practices of xp this gives a new perspective to agile processes and enables others to express agile practices in a more generic way it is shown that agility is a result of a more effective knowledge creation process involving both the customer and development team based on this practical implications and future research needs are identified 2003 ieee comparing software development processes using information theory information theory is used to identify the criteria for comparing software development processes we then use the criteria

2002 knowledge management support for distributed agile software processes agile software development has put a new focus on the question of how to share knowledge among members of software development teams in contrast to heavy weight document centric approaches agile approaches rely on face to face communication for knowledge transfer pure face to face communication is not feasible when applying agile processes in a virtual team setting in this paper we argue that the right approach for virtual software development teams using agile methods lies between a radical none but source code standpoint and the multitude of documents proposed by heavy weight development standards this paper introduces work on developing a system for the task based capture and pro active distribution of recurrent information needs that typically arise for developers as well as potential ways to satisfy these information needs our approach facilitates an incremental organizational learning process to capture and maintain knowledge on what documentation information is actually needed such that documentation is created on an as needed basis springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2003 task oriented knowledge management support virtual agile teams the economics of software development by pair programmers evidence suggests that pair programmers two programmers working collaboratively on the same design algorithm code or test perform substantially better than the two would working alone improved quality teamwork communication knowledge management and morale have been among the reported benefits of pair programming this paper presents a comparative economic evaluation that strengthens the case for pair programming the evaluation builds on the quantitative results of an empirical study conducted at the university of utah the evaluation is performed by interpreting these findings in the context of two different idealized models of value realization in the first model consistent with the traditional waterfall process of software development code produced by a development team is deployed in a single increment its value is not realized until the full project completion in the second model consistent with agile software development processes such as extreme programming code is produced and delivered in small increments thus its value is realized in an equally incremental fashion under both models our analysis demonstrates a distinct economic advantage of pair programmers over solo programmers based on these preliminary results we recommend that organizations engaged in software development consider adopting pair programming as a practice that could improve their bottom line to be able to perform quantitative analyses several simplifying assumptions had to be made regarding alternative models of software development the costs and benefits associated with these models and how these costs and benefits are recognized the implications of these assumptions are addressed in the paper knowledge sharing agile methods vs tayloristic methods 2003 ieee this paper presents a comparative analysis of knowledge sharing approaches of agile and tayloristic traditional

this paper we describe how we extended the existing km tool prime by collaborative filtering techniques in order to pro actively provide users with task specific recommendations of potentially relevant information items the resulting hybrid system thus allows for both the formal specification of when to offer what information to whom and heuristic based information recommendation
