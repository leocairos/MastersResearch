mining and recommending software features across multiple web repositories the internetware paradigm is fundamentally changing the traditional way of software development more and more software projects are developed maintained and shared on the internet however a large quantity of heterogeneous software resources have not been organized in a reasonable and efficient way software feature is an ideal material to characterize software resources the effectiveness of feature related tasks will be greatly improved if a multi grained feature repository is available in this paper we propose a novel approach for organizing analyzing and recommend ing software features firstly we construct a hierarchical repository of software feature hesa then we mine the hidden affnities among the features and recommend relevant and high quality features to stakeholders based on hesa finally we conduct a user study to evaluate our approach quantitatively the results show that hesa can organize software features in a more reasonable way compared to the traditional and the state of the art approaches the result of feature recommendation is effective and interesting categories and subject descriptors d

on tology mining software repository recommender system enhancing trustworthiness evaluation in internetware with similarity and non negative constraints internetware is envisioned as a new software paradigm where software developers usually need to interact with unknown partners as well as the software entities developed by them to reduce uncertainty and boost collaborations in such setting it is important to provide trustworthiness evaluation mechanisms so that trustworthy partners entities can be easily found in this work we propose a novel trustworthiness evaluation mechanism by enhancing existing mechanisms with similarity and non negative constraints to be specific we first extend an existing multi aspect trust inference model by incorporating the non negative constraint one of the advantages of such constraint is its strong interpretability second we incorporate similarity into two neighborhood models borrowed from recommender systems when computing similarity we make use of the intermediate results from the first step finally these models are combined under a machine learning framework to show the effectiveness of our method we conduct experiments on a real data set the results show that both our non negativity extension and similarity computation improve the evaluation accuracy of the original methods and the combined method outperforms several state of the art methods internetware multi aspect non negativity similarity trustworthiness evaluation a distributed anonymization scheme for privacy preserving recommendation systems recommendation systems need to collect user personal data for predicting user preferences the privacy of user personal data becomes a main concern when users are served by the recommendation system in this paper we study the problem of privacy preserving recommendation in the case that the user data are locally stored in a distributed manner we present a distributed anonymization scheme based on the proposed anonymization map the proposed scheme allows users individually anonymize their own data without accessing each other s data the experiment results show that the proposed scheme can preserve the privacy of collaborative users and outperform the perturbation based scheme 2013 ieee anonymization privacy recommendation systems a context aware matrix factorization recommender algorithm latent factor models based on matrix tensor factorization techniques are widely recognized in recommender systems however matrix tensor factorization techniques are computationally intensive which greatly limits their usages in real world projects to address this problem we improve the classic matrix factorization models by establishing fuzzy mapping relationships between contexts and latent factors and making use of contextual information to initialize user item feature vectors experimental results on standard test set movielens 1m show that the proposed algorithms could achieve far better prediction accuracy while reducing the iteration number by 25 2013 ieee context latent factor matrix tensor factorization recommender system clustering collaborative filtering recommendation system based on svd algorithm the most important responsibility for every recommendation system is how to make the appropriate personalized recommendation for different customers rapidly and effectively collaborative filtering recommendation is one of the most popular methods among the e commerce system but it still remains some problems such as cold start and data sparse at the same time more and more users registering on make the real time and expansibility of a system hard to be kept in the paper according to a series of problems such as data sparse and bad real time caused by a large number of registering users we propose a new approach combining the clustering algorithm with svd algorithm which is widely used in the domain of image processing into collaborative filtering algorithm firstly we classify the users by using the attributes of them then we decompose the rating matrix with the svd algorithm and reunion them into new rating matrix to calculate the similarity between each pair of users at last we take advantage of the similarity to find the nearest neighbors in the collaborative filtering recommendation and predict the ratings of the items to make the recommendation our experiments show that the approach cannot only improve the cold start and data sparse problems but also increase the efficiency and scalability of a system 2013 ieee clustering collaborative filtering e commerce svd discovery of technical expertise from open source code repositories online question and answer websites for developers have emerged as the main forums for interaction during the software development process the veracity of an answer in such websites is typically verified by the number of upvotes that the answer garners from peer programmers using the same forum although this mechanism has proved to be extremely successful in rating the usefulness of the answers it does not lend itself very elegantly to model the expertise of a user in a particular domain in this paper we propose a model to rank the expertise of the developers in a target domain by mining their activity in different opensource projects to demonstrate the validity of the model we built a recommendation system for stackoverflow which uses the data mined from github github knowledge discovery recommendations source code repository stackoverflow technical expertise investigating confidence displays for top n recommendations recommendation systems often compute fixed length lists of recommended items to users forcing the system to predict a fixed length list for each user may result in different confidence levels for the computed recommendations reporting the system s confidence in its predictions the recommendation strength can provide valuable information to users in making their decisions in this article we investigate several different displays of a system s confidence to users and conclude that some displays are easier to understand and are favored by most users we continue to investigate the effect confidence has on users in terms of their perception of the recommendation quality and the user experience with the system our studies show that it is not easier for users to identify relevant items when confidence is displayed still users appreciate the displays and trust them when the relevance of items is difficult to establish 2013 asis t recommending software architecture for customized learning management system in this work we have studied the learning management systems lmss and proposed a reference model serving to both analysis and synthesis of lmss such model has been implemented and evaluated being composed of two representations and facilities specially oriented to two important actors in lms development these actors are the author and the developer where a concept map is offered to the first one in order to help authors to select services that will compose the intended lms the flexible reference architecture is dedicated to the software developers in order to help them to implement the user s requirements in this paper we propose a knowledge based recommender system to automatically approximate these two representations through rules that map the needs of the author in design decisions to developers hence the system may recommend a new architecture for customized lms or even an existing lms to the author the proposed system has been evaluated in the task of constructing a specific lms thus showing positive results 2013 aisti lms and reference model recommender system handling missing attributes using matrix factorization predictive models that use machine learning techniques has been useful tools to guide software project managers in making decisions under uncertainty however in practice collecting metrics or defect data has been a troublesome job and researchers often have to deal with incomplete datasets in their studies as a result both researchers and practitioners shy away from implementing such models missing data is a common problem in other domains to build recommender systems we believe that the techniques used to overcome missing data problem in other domains can also be employed in software engineering in this paper we propose matrix factorization algorithm to tackle with missing data problem in building predictive models in software development domain 2013 ieee

business software development is required to be conducted more efficiently in particular software maintenance holds the majority in the costs of software development developers must understand a

add bookmarks of web pages with freely chosen keywords as tags personalized recommender systems recommend new and useful bookmarks added by other users we propose a new method to find similar users and to select relevant bookmarks in a social book marking service our method is lightweight because it uses a small set of important tags for each user to find useful bookmarks to recommend our method is also powerful because it employs the wikipedia category database to deal with the diversity of tags among users the evaluation using the hatena bookmark service in japan shows that our method significantly increases the number of relevant bookmarks recommended without notable increase of irrelevant bookmarks 2013 ieee algorithm folksonomy recommender tagging a customized visiting route service under rfid environment how to provide a high quality service according to consumer preference becomes a critical issue for amusement park to survive in a rapidly changing environment to fulfill the need this research proposes a customized visiting route service that provides tourists what facilities they should visit and in what order in the studied environment all regions are covered by radio frequency identification rfid readers so that the visiting behavior of a tourist i e visiting location sequences and corresponding timestamps can be collected and stored in a route database the proposed route recommendation service consists of two major modules the first module is to discover the frequent location item time lit sequential patterns using the proposed sequential pattern mining procedure in the second module the route suggestion procedure will filter the lit sequential patterns under the constraints of intended visiting time favorite regions with its related visiting time and favorite recreation facilities then select the top k suggested routes to guide the visitors to show the feasibility of the proposed route recommendation system the tokyo disneysea in japan is used as an example based on the experimental results it is clear that the recommended route can not only follow previous tourists visiting experiences but also satisfy the visitor s

requirements sustainability is not considered sufficiently in developing modern software systems in spite of the looming threats of global climate change and environmental degradation 1 software companies are more concerned with product time to market than long term product impacts the research goal of this project is to overcome the barriers of incorporating sustainability into the software engineering process through the use of a recommender system to be used during requirements engineering this system will recommend the kinds of sustainability requirements that should be considered in a given system based on application domain deployment locale etc and in so doing will lessen the workload of eliciting appropriate sustainability requirements this research builds on an ongoing research project on software engineering for sustainability 2013 ieee 2013 2nd international workshop on user evaluations for software engineering researchers user 2013 proceedings the proceedings contain 5 papers the topics discussed include empirical evaluation of research prototypes at variable stages of maturity surveying developer knowledge and interest in code smells through online freelance marketplaces how to evaluate a conflict minimizing task scheduler through a user study on planning an evaluation of the impact of identifier names on the readability and quality of smalltalk programs and a proposed recommender system for eliciting software sustainability requirements utilizing software reuse experience for automated test recommendation the development of defect tests is still a very labour intensive process that demands a high level of domain knowledge concentration and problem awareness from software engineers any technology that can reduce the manual effort involved in this process therefore has the potential to significantly reduce software development costs and time consumption an idea for achieving this is to reuse the knowledge bound up in already existing test cases either directly or indirectly to assist in the development of tests for new software components and systems although general software reuse has received a lot of attention in the past both in academia and industry previous research has focussed on the reuse and recommendation of existing software artifacts in the creation of new product code rather than on the recommendation of tests in this paper we focus on the latter and present a novel automated test recommendation approach that leverages lessons learned from traditional software reuse to proactively make test case suggestions while an engineer is developing tests in contrast most existing testing assistance tools provide ex post assistance to test developers in the form of coverage assessments and test quality evaluations our goal is to create an automated non intrusive recommendation system for efficient software test development in this paper we set out the basic strategy by which this can be achieved and present a prototypical implementation of our test recommender system for eclipse 2013 ieee probabilistic topic models for sequence data probabilistic topic models are widely used in different contexts to uncover the hidden structure in large text corpora one of the main and perhaps strong assumption of these models is that generative process follows a bag of words assumption i e each token is independent from the previous one we extend the popular latent dirichlet allocation model by exploiting three different conditional markovian assumptions i the token generation depends on the current topic and on the previous token ii the topic associated with each observation depends on topic associated with the previous one iii the token generation depends on the current and previous topic for each of these modeling assumptions we present a gibbs sampling procedure for parameter estimation experimental evaluation over real word data shows the performance advantages in terms of recall and

algorithm for generating recommendations in open journal systems the use of articles from scientific journals is an important part of research based teaching at universities the selection of relevant work from among the increasing amount of scientific literature can be problematic the challenge is to find relevant recommendations especially when the related articles are not obviously linked this paper seeks to discuss these issues this paper focuses on the analysis of user activity traces in journals using the open source software open journal the research questions to what extent end users follow a certain link structure given within ojs or immediately select the articles according to their interests in the latter case the recorded data sets are used for creating further recommendations the analysis is based on an article matrix displaying the usage frequency of articles and their user selected successive articles within the ojs furthermore the navigation paths are analysed it was found that the users tend to follow a set navigation structure moreover a hybrid recommendation system for ojs is described which uses content based filtering as the basic system extended by the results of a collaborative filtering approach the paper presents two original contributions the analysis of user path tracing and a novel algorithm that allows smooth integration of new articles into

recommendation systems based on context aware composition to enable a system designer to postpone and automate decisions regarding efficiency non functional requirements such as performance and focus on the design of the core functionality of the system instead context aware composition suggests the optimal component variants of a system for different static contexts e g software and hardware environment or even different dynamic contexts e g actual parameters and resource utilization thus an efficiency non functional requirement can be automatically optimized statically or dynamically by providing possible component variants such a recommender system reduces time and effort spent on manually developing optimal applications that adapts to different static or dynamic contexts and even

code recent advances in recommendation systems for software engineering software engineers must contend with situations in which they are exposed to an excess of information cannot readily express the kinds of information they need or must make decisions where computation of the unequivocally correct answer is infeasible recommendation systems have the potential to assist in such cases this paper overviews some recent developments in recommendation systems for software engineering and points out their similarities to and differences from more typical commercial applications of recommendation systems the paper focuses in particular on the problem of software reuse and speculates why the recently cancelled google code search project was doomed to failure as a general purpose tool 2013 springer verlag classification opportunities overview rsses multi back ends for a model library abstraction layer software development is moving in the direction of modeling as do quite a lot of other it related tasks this means models become more and more important either as a means of communication or as parts of realizations unfortunately these models are rarely reused which might be due to poor tool support a model recommender system is one possible way out but it bases on high quality data which is most likely stored in a database and needs to blend into an environment hence approaching model recommendations in a model driven way and generating the underlying data store which makes do with an existing infrastructure is desirable in this paper we describe the underlying model and the obstacles we had to overcome to make this approach work for relational and non relational databases 2013 springer verlag berlin heidelberg eclipse modeling framework emf model library model recommender model reuse multi database a systematic approach for designing educational recommender systems 2014 igi global the construction of educational recommender system ers demands the incorporation of quality attributes at the software design such as availability for preventing the service to be unavailable for a long time and scalability for preventing the system from going offline due to a large number of simultaneous requests the incorporation of such characteristics makes ers more complex and expensive but existing strategies for designing ers do not consider quality attributes in an explicit way this chapter presents an architecture centered solution which is partially supported by tools and considers quality attributes as early as possible in the software development process in a systematic way from requirements to the source code the feasibility of the proposed process is showed in terms of a case study executed in a step by step fashion presenting how the software architecture can be designed and gradually refined until it achieves the level of object oriented classes generated based on design patterns the user information based mobile application recommender system smart phone and tablet pc users would like the variety of application contents in addition to web searching most of the mobile application stores tend to recommend other users applications merely because they have been chosen by many users thus users who would like to choose applications that they personally prefer from hundreds of thousands of applications in mobile application stores need to spend a lot of time and efforts this paper suggests a collaborative filtering cf method in utilization of users device id information and the weight of certain demography information in order to minimize problems stated above and enhance the accuracy of recommendations this method extracts preferred category information for each age bracket based on application categories and users age information and decides the ranks in consideration of the similarity reflected in the weight of certain applications within the category based on the users information the experiment shows that the proposed method improved the performance which made accuracy of recommendation better than ranking based method collaborative filtering demography information mobile

effective recommendation method for cold start new users using trust and distrust networks recommendation systems analyze the purchasing behavior e g item ratings of users to learn about their preferences and recommend products or services that may be of interest to them however as new users require time to become familiar with recommendation systems the systems usually have limited information about newcomers and have difficulty providing appropriate recommendations this so called new user cold start phenomenon has a serious impact on the performance of recommendation systems as a result there has been increasing research in recent years into new user cold start recommendation methods that try to provide useful item recommendations for cold start new users the rationale behind much of the research is that recommending items to new users generally creates a sense of belonging and loyalty and encourages them to frequently utilize recommendation systems in this paper we propose a cold start recommendation method for the new user that integrates a user model with trust and distrust networks to identify trustworthy users the suggestions of these users are then aggregated to provide useful recommendations for cold start new users experiments based on the well known epinions dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method moreover the method outperforms well known recommendation methods for cold start new users in terms of the recall rate f1 score coverage rate users coverage and execution time without a significant reduction in the

development parallel changes in which separate lines of development are carried out by different developments are a basic fact of developing and maintaining large scale software systems merging parallel versions and variants of source code is a common and essential software engineering activity when a non trivial number of conflicts is detected there is a need to support the maintainer in investigating and resolving these conflicts in this study the authors present software conflict resolution recommender scorerec a cost benefit approach to ranking the conflicting software entities the contributions of scorerec lie in the leverage of both structural and semantic information of the source code to generate conflict resolution recommendations as well as the hierarchical presentation of the recommendations with detailed explanations the authors evaluate scorerec through an industrial strength legacy system developed by computational scientists the results show that scorerec offers relevant and insightful information and sound engineering support for conflict resolution the authors work also sheds light on the future development of recommendation systems in the context of

institute graduate school recording attribute frequencies and calculating user preferences on attributes are generally used in current personalized method user profile for recommender system in this paper we propose a new personalized method namely abey to do the personalization in another way abey firstly uses attribute entropies to calculates user preferences on attribute classes abey refines these preferences by wiping off some interferences and allocates a group of such preferences for each user at the end of measurement abey could re rank given recommendations according to aggregate attribute class preferences for them experiments are conducted on data sets collected from an e commerce site in real world the effectiveness of abey including accuracy coverage and novelty has been evaluated and the results indicate that abey can be a superior alternative to user profile on finding related items for individuals attribute entropy personalized method recommender systems user preference user profile a new similarity function for selecting neighbors for each target item in collaborative filtering as one of the collaborative filtering cf techniques memory based cf technique which recommends items to users based on rating information of like minded users called neighbors has been widely used and has also proven to be useful in many practices in the age of information overload however there is still considerable room for improving the quality of recommendation shortly similarity functions in traditional cf compute a similarity between a target user and the other user without considering a target item more specifically they give an equal weight to each of the co rated items rated by both users neighbors of a target user therefore are identical for all target items however a reasonable assumption is that the similarity between a target item and each of the co rated items should be considered when finding neighbors of a target user additionally a different set of neighbors should be selected for each different target item thus the objective of this paper is to propose a new similarity function in order to select different neighbors for each different target item in the new similarity function the rating of a user on an item is weighted by the item similarity between the item and the target item experimental results from movielens dataset and netflix dataset provide evidence that our recommender model considerably outperforms the traditional cf based recommender model 2012 elsevier b v all rights reserved collaborative filtering information overload item similarity recommendation system comparing collaborative filtering methods based on user topic ratings copyright 2013 by knowledge systems institute graduate school user based collaborative filtering cf has been successfully applied into recommender system for years the main idea of user based cf is to discover communities of users sharing similar interests however existing user based cf methods may be inaccurate due to the problem of data sparsity one possible way to improve it is to append new data sources into user based cf tags which are added and generated by users is one of the new sources in order to utilize tags effectively user topic based cf is proposed to extract features behind tags assign them to topics and measure users preferences on these topics in this paper we conduct comparisons between two user topic based cf methods based on different tag topic relations both methods calculate user topic preferences according to ratings of items and topic weights experiments are conducted on the data set of movielens the results show that usertopic based cf method is better than user based cf both in computational efficiency and recommendation effect the effects are significant especially when each tag belongs to multiple topics collaborative filtering recommender systems tag topic model blog recommender based on hypergraph modeling clustering algorithm in this paper we presents a new blog recommender based on the hyper graph modeling clustering algorithm the algorithm of this system is called multilevel clustering segmentation algorithm based on the hyper graph model under the hyper graph model each blog will be abstracted as a vertex of a hyper graph hyper edges will be built among the blogs which belong to the same result set gotten through the google blog searching by one keyword then the problem of recommender is translated into the clustering of a hyper graph our multilevel clustering algorithm is then used to do the segmentation and we set a new optimization index for the segmentation of a hyper graph which is called modularity through the definition of modularity it is not necessary for us to preset the partitioning number any more we do the segmentation with the aim to achieve the optimum value of modularity in addition hyper graph is born with the ability to solve problems with high dimension data and this ability of course will lead to more reasonable results compared with other models 2013 ieee hypergraph model modularity multilevel clustering segmentation algorithm recommender system discovering and studying collaboration networks in software repositories collaboration is important to software development processes and collaboration networks help us understand its structure and patterns a common problem however is that these networks are not known and need to be discovered in this work we study collaboration networks of five projects using an existing method that mines these networks from version control systems the method is based on recommender system techniques and finds similar developers by analyzing commits that are made to common files these similarities are then used to automatically construct the network and it is visualized using a force directed graph layout algorithm two of the studied projects come from industry and are closed source while the other three are open source in each study we learn some of the project s collaboration form and organization we also were able to find various aspects of these projects that were previously not known

increasingly rely on information from the web such as documents or code examples on application programming interfaces apis to facilitate their development processes however api documents often do not include enough information for developers to fully understand how to use the apis and searching for good code examples requires considerable effort to address this problem we propose a novel code

schemes on mimo ofdm lte and graph mining a survey of graph mining techniques seeking the ground truth a retroactive study on the evolution and migration of software libraries application programming interfaces apis are a common and industrially relevant means for third party software developers to reuse external functionality several techniques have been proposed to help migrate client code between library versions with incompatible apis but it is not clear how well these perform in an absolute sense we present a retroactive study into the presence and nature of api incompatibilities between several versions of a set of java based software libraries for each we perform a detailed manual analysis to determine what the correct adaptations are to migrate from the older to the newer version in addition we investigate whether any of a set of adaptation recommender techniques is capable of identifying the correct adaptations for library migration we find that a given api incompatibility can typically be addressed by only one or two recommender techniques but sometimes none serve furthermore those techniques give correct recommendations on average in only about 20 of cases 2012 acm adaptive change api recommendation systems who is going to mentor newcomers in open source projects when newcomers join a software project they need to be properly trained to understand the technical and organizational aspects of the project inadequate training could likely lead to project delay or failure in this paper we propose an approach named yoda young and newcomer developer assistant aimed at identifying and recommending mentors in software projects by mining data from mailing lists and versioning systems candidate mentors are identified among experienced developers who actively interact with newcomers then when a newcomer joins the project yoda recommends her a mentor that among the available ones has already discussed topics relevant for the newcomer yoda has been evaluated on software repositories of five open source projects we have also surveyed some developers of these projects to understand whether mentoring was actually performed in their projects and asked them to evaluate the mentoring relations yoda identified results indicate that top committers are not always the most appropriate mentors and show the potential usefulness of yoda as a recommendation system to aid project managers in supporting newcomers joining a software project 2012 acm developer mentoring empirical studies mining software repositories a source code recommender system to support newcomers newcomers in a software development project often need assistance to complete their first tasks then a mentor an experienced member of the team usually teaches the newcomers what they need to complete their tasks but to allocate an experienced member of a team to teach a newcomer during a long time is neither always possible nor desirable because the mentor could be more helpful doing more important tasks during the development the team interacts with a version control system bug tracking and mailing lists and all these tools record data creating the project memory recommender systems can use the project memory to help newcomers in some tasks answering their questions thus in some cases the developers do not need a mentor in this paper we present mentor a recommender system to help newcomers to solve change requests mentor uses the prediction by partial matching ppm algorithm and some heuristics to analyze the change requests and the version control data and recommend potentially relevant source code that will help the developer in the change request solution we did three experiments to compare the ppm algorithm with the latent semantic indexing lsi using ppm we achieved results for recall rate between 37 and 66 8 and using lsi the results were between 20 3 and 51 6 2012 ieee information theory recommender systems software engineering software maintenance heuristic strategies for recommendation of exception handling code software developers have difficulties in implementing exception handling code in their systems in particular they fail in implementing appropriate handling actions not surprisingly recurring failures and performance issues are often related to the poor exception handling actions implemented in real software systems in this paper we propose implement and evaluate a set of three heuristic strategies used to recommend exception handling code in programming tasks given a method in which the developer wants to handle an exception the heuristics recommend a list of code fragments implementing exception handling the heuristics goal is to accurately find code fragments implementing exception handling and recommend these fragments according to the context of developers implementation task hence the proposed heuristics may assist developers in the process of discovering exception handling actions relevant to their context by providing concrete examples we believe that a recommender system based on the proposed heuristics may be used in the future as a tool for aiding exception handling implementation 2012 ieee code example recommendation exception handling heuristic strategies breaking the big bang practice of traceability pushing timely trace recommendations to project stakeholders in many software intensive systems traceability is used to support a variety of software engineering activities such as impact analysis compliance verification and requirements validation however in practice traceability links are often created towards the end of the project specifically for approval or certification purposes this practice can result in inaccurate and incomplete traces and also means that traceability links are not available to support early development efforts we address these problems by presenting a trace recommender system which pushes recommendations to project stakeholders as they create or modify traceable artifacts we also introduce the novel concept of a trace obligation which is used to track satisfaction relations between a target artifact and a set of source artifacts we model traceability events and subsequent actions including user recommendations using the business process modeling notation bpmn we demonstrate and evaluate the efficacy of our approach through an illustrative example and a simulation conducted using the software engineering artifacts of a robotic system for supporting arm rehabilitation our results show that tracking trace obligations and generating trace recommendations throughout the active phases of a project can lead to early construction of traceability knowledge 2012 ieee maintenance requirements traceability

recommendation code bases contain often millions lines of code code recommendation systems ease programming by proposing developers mined and extracted use cases of a code base currently recommender systems are based on hardcoded sets what makes it complicate to adapt them another research area is adaptable live detection of code clones we advance clone detection and code recommender systems by presenting utilization of our hypermodelling approach to realize an alternative technique this approach uses data warehousing technology that scales for big data and allows for flexible and adaptable queries of source code we present the generic idea to advance recommendation and clone detection based on queries and to evaluate our application with industry source code consequently recommender systems and clone detection can be customized with flexible queries via hypermodelling this enables further research about more complex clone detection and context sensitive code recommendation data warehousing hypermodelling software engineering improving a recommender system through integration of user profiles a semantic approach the users are present in multiple social networks virtualcom munities and each one can be considered as a source of information about this user in face to this question it is important a mechanism to integrate the user profiles through the integration of user profiles it is possible identifier more accurately their interests analyzing other data sources that they are present possible reducing the cold start problem in this context we present a semantic approach to help integrate data from multiple sources for the construction and maintenance of user profiles that will be used to improve the quality of a recommender system to integrate data from multiple sources we defined a heuristic that quantifies the importance of each data source for a given user to validate our approach we perform a case study where the solution was coupled into a recommender system of papers focused in software engineering domain the user profiles were built extracting their information from the brazilian curriculum vitae database named cv lattes an academic platform and linkedin a business network we compared the quality of the recommendation based on the profiles integrated and non integrated the results show the superior quality of the recommendation

requirements engineering is a very critical phase in software development process requirements can be interpreted as basic decision alternatives which have to be negotiated by stakeholders in this paper we present the results of an empirical study which focused on the analysis of key influence factors of successful requirements prioritization this study has been conducted within the scope of software development projects at our university where development teams interacted with a requirements prioritization environment the major result of our study is that anonymized preference elicitation can help to significantly improve the quality of requirements prioritization for example in terms of the degree of team consensus prioritization diversity and quality of the resulting software components group decision making requirements prioritization design pattern selection a solution strategy method design patterns represent a highly effective way to improve the quality of software system due to its ability to capture the best practices and design knowledge this enable software engineer to develop their applications unfortunately choosing suitable patterns to specific design problems are difficult task for novice over the past years of research in the field of software engineering several conferences and workshops are focused on writing and publishing patterns this increases the degree of challenges that face the developer in determining the suitable design patterns this paper presents method to facilitate and assist the designers in selecting the suitable patterns for their problems we propose a strategy method to obtain the appropriate recommendation 2012 ieee case based reasoning design pattern selection information retrieval techniques recommender

and toolkits have also been used in many recent studies on software mining and analytics that aim to automate various software engineering tasks with the increasing number of important applications of machine learning systems the reliability of such systems is also becoming increasingly important a necessary step for ensuring reliability of such systems is to understand the features and characteristics of bugs occurred in the systems a number of studies have investigated bugs and fixes in various software systems but none focuses on machine learning systems machine learning systems

respectively we look into their bug databases and code repositories analyze a sample set of bugs and corresponding fixes and label the bugs into various categories our study finds that 22 6 of the bugs belong to the algorithm method category 15 6 of the bugs belong to the non functional category and 13 of the bugs belong to the assignment initialization category we also report the relationship

entrainment of contention to innovation recommender systems for manual testing deciding how to assign tests in a test team background software testing can be an arduous and expensive activity a typical activity to maximise testing productivity is to allocate test cases according to the testers profile however optimising the allocation of manual test cases is not a trivial task in big companies test managers are responsible for allocating hundreds of test cases among several testers objective in this paper we propose and evaluate 2 assignment algorithms for test case allocation and 3 tester profiles based on recommender systems each assignment algorithm can be combined with 3 tester profiles which results in six possible allocation systems method we run a controlled experiment that uses 100 test suites each one with at least 50 test cases from a real industrial setting in order to compare our allocation systems to the manager s allocation in terms of precision recall and unassignment percentage of test cases the algorithm could not allocate results in our experiment the statistical analysis shows that one of the systems outperforms the others with respect to the precision and recall metrics for unassignment three of our six allocation systems achieved zero best value for the unassignment rate conclusion the results of our experiment suggest that in similar environments test managers can use our allocation systems to reduce the amount of time spent in the test case allocation task in the real industrial setting in which our work was developed managers spend from 16 to 30 working days a year on test case allocation our algorithms can help them do it faster and better copyright 2012 acm manual testing recommender systems test allocation user weight model for item based recommendation systems nowadays item based collaborative filtering cf has been widely used as an effective way to help people cope with information overload it computes the item item similarities differentials and then selects the most similar items for prediction a weakness of current typical itembased cf approaches is that all users have the same weight in computing the item relationships in order to improve the recommendation quality we incorporate users weights based on a relationship model of users into item similarities and differentials computing in this paper a model of user relationship a method for computing users weights and weight based item item similarities differentials computing approaches are proposed for item based cf recommendations finally we experimentally evaluate our approach for recommendation and compare it to typical item based cf approaches based on adjusted cosine and slope one the experiments show that our approaches can improve the recommendation results of them 2012 academy publisher collaboration filtering item based filtering personalized recommendation relationship model an approach to context based recommendation in software development a software developer programming in an object oriented programming language deals with a source code structure that may contain hundreds of source code elements these elements are commonly related to each other and working on a specific element may require the developer to access other related elements we propose a recommendation ap proach that uses the context of the developer to retrieve and rank recommendations of relevant source code elements in the ide these recommendations provide a shortcut to reach the desired elements and increase the awareness of the developer in relation to elements that may be of interest in that moment we have tested our approach with a group of developers and the results show that context has a promis ing role in predicting and ranking the source code elements needed by a developer at each moment copyright 2012 by the association for computing machinery inc acm context modeling ide ontologies recommendation systems software development

collaborative filtering grade prediction software tool student success a balanced memory based collaborative filtering similarity measure collaborative filtering recommender systems contribute to alleviating the problem of information overload that exists on the internet as a result of the mass use of web 2 0 applications the use of an adequate similarity measure becomes a determining factor in the quality of the prediction and recommendation results of the recommender system as well as in its performance in this paper we present a memory based collaborative filtering similarity measure that provides extremely high quality and balanced results these results are complemented with a low processing time high performance similar to the one required to execute traditional similarity metrics the experiments have been carried out on the movielens and netflix databases using a representative set of information retrieval quality measures 2012 wiley periodicals inc model recommendation for action recognition simply choosing one model out of a large set of possibilities for a given vision task is a surprisingly difficult problem especially if there is limited evaluation data with which to distinguish among models such as when choosing the best walk action classifier from a large pool of classifiers tuned for different viewing angles lighting conditions and background clutter in this paper we suggest that this problem of selecting a good model can be recast as a recommendation problem where the goal is to recommend a good model for a particular task based on how well a limited probe set of models appears to perform through this conceptual remapping we can bring to bear all the collaborative filtering techniques developed for consumer recommender systems e g netflix amazon com we test this hypothesis on action recognition and find that even when every model has been directly rated on a training set recommendation finds better selections for the corresponding test set than the best performers on the training set 2012 ieee a fuzzy mobile recommender system jqmobile vs flashbuilder implementations mobility and logistics activities could be supported effectively if the mobile users may know the best path to destination and the loading and unloading paths by means of navigators based on the current traffic and weather conditions also personal data as well user preferences should be considered by the navigators to generate effective recommendations however not all the relevant data may be known in a precise way since they often derive from statistical information as well as knowing all the real time information is not always feasible due to the high cost of the sensing systems moreover we don t have simple mathematical models able to generate fast right recommendations as required in the rapidly evolving scenarios featuring the activities of walking and driving people for this reason the paper aims at illustrating how fuzzy logic may be used for computing measurements and perceptions by qualitative rules and to generate timely recommendations helpful to mobile users these recommendations will consider the environmental conditions in real time the current personal constraints and the preferences expressed in the past by the users the paper not only proposes the methodology but also illustrates how a ruby on rails server provided with a proper jqmobile interface may offer such location intelligence services taking also advantage from the information coming from social networks a flash builder

preferences to attributes of books for personalized recommendation personalized recommendation and user preference to books have aroused lots of attention both domestically and abroad and fruitful achievements have been made in this area nevertheless the previous preference models mainly focus on the content of books and ignore the attribute of price of a book in an actual book recommendation system the price influences the consumers buying behavior to a large extent and should be considered seriously based on the existing preference models in addition to the attributes of the publisher publishing date discount and the other consumers reviews this study takes the attribute of price into consideration to a particular book the dummy variable regression method is employed to analyze the data mainly from amazon through data analysis and investigation this paper tries to explore the importance of its different attributes in the user preference to a book in accordance with the data

general problem of waiting in a long queue to make a hospital registration correct registration is an efficient way to avoid wasting medical resources and the prerequisite of getting timely inspection and treatment the purpose of this research is to build a disease self inspection and hospital registration recommendation system to help people do the disease self inspection and make an online registration fast firstly the system assists people to make a rough disease self inspection by checking different symptoms of body parts secondly people are recommended to corresponding hospital registration departments to make an online registration during the above procedures some factors are seriously considered such as the disease and allergy history of the user the department hierarchy in hospitals of different levels in china current situation of medical resources and so on which may affect the results of the disease self inspection and registration recommendation greatly the system works well as an information service on the regional medical information sharing and collaborative platform which is based on cloud computing and set up by our team as a result it can be monitored controlled and further improved 2012 ieee disease self inspection drools jboss rules healthcare hospital registration system restful web service the application of the pso based community

gmbh community structure personalized recommendation pso based cda sns making the leap to a software platform strategy issues and challenges context while there are many success stories of achieving high reuse and improved quality using software platforms there is a need to investigate the issues and challenges organizations face when transitioning to a software platform strategy objective this case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium scale organization decided to adopt software platforms the study also reveals how new trends in software engineering i e agile methods distributed development and flat management structures interplayed with the chosen platform strategy method we used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium scale company in scandinavia we conducted 16 in depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams three of which were working on three separate platforms the collected data was analyzed using grounded theory results the findings identify four classes of challenges namely business challenges organizational challenges technical challenges and people challenges the article explains how these findings can be used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool support conclusion the organization s decision to adopt a software platform strategy introduced a number of challenges these challenges need to be understood and addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse researchers need to further investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for platform development the role of agile methods in software platforms tool support for testing and continuous integration in the platform context and reuse recommendation systems 2012 elsevier b v all rights reserved ethnographic study grounded theory platform challenges software platform software reuse an empirical study of supplementary bug fixes a recent study finds that errors of omission are harder for programmers to detect than errors of commission while several change recommendation systems already exist to prevent or reduce omission errors during software development there have been very few studies on why errors of omission occur in practice and how such errors could be prevented in order to understand the characteristics of omission errors this paper investigates a group of bugs that were fixed more than once in open source projects those bugs whose initial patches were later considered incomplete and to which programmers applied supplementary patches our study on eclipse jdt core eclipse swt and mozilla shows that a significant portion of resolved bugs 22 to 33 involves more than one fix attempt our manual inspection shows that the causes of omission errors are diverse including missed porting changes incorrect handling of conditional statements or incomplete refactorings etc while many consider that missed updates to code clones often lead to omission errors only a very small portion of supplementary patches 12 in jdt 25 in swt and 9 in mozilla have a content similar to their initial patches this implies that supplementary change

approaches that complement existing change recommendation systems 2012 ieee bug fixes empirical study patches software evolution a systematic approach for designing educational recommender systems the construction of educational recommender system ers demands the incorporation of quality attributes at the software design such as availability for preventing the service to be unavailable for a long time and scalability for preventing the system from going offline due to a large number of simultaneous requests the incorporation of such characteristics makes ers more complex and expensive but existing strategies for designing ers do not consider quality attributes in an explicit way this chapter presents an architecture centered solution which is partially supported by tools and considers quality attributes as early as possible in the software development process in a systematic way from requirements to the source code the feasibility of the proposed process is showed in terms of a case study executed in a step by step fashion presenting how the software architecture can be designed and gradually refined until it achieves the level of object oriented classes generated based on design patterns 2012 igi global knowledge engineering support for agent oriented software reuse automating software engineering tasks is essential to achieve better productivity in software development and quality of software products knowledge engineering can address this challenge through the representation and reuse of knowledge of how and when to perform a development task this chapter describes a knowledge based approach for automating agent oriented development whose main components are a software process madae pro and an integrated development environment madaeide madae pro is an ontology driven process for multi agent domain and application engineering which promotes the construction and reuse of agent oriented application families madae ide is an integrated development environment which assists developers in the application of madae pro allowing full or partial automation of its modeling tasks through a set of production rules that explores the semantic representation of modeling products in its knowledge base the approach has been evaluated through the development of a multi agent system family of recommender systems supporting alternative collaborative content based and hybrid filtering techniques some examples from these case studies are presented to illustrate and detail the domain analysis and application requirements engineering

entrainment of contention to innovation subjectivity handling of ratings for trust and reputation systems an abductive reasoning approach the majority of trust models consider two types of knowledge in estimating the trustworthiness of a trustee in an interaction experiences and recommendations however this leads to a nested trust problem how could we trust the recommendations even when the recommenders are not deceptive there is still a trust related problem due to the subjectivity of human judgment this paper describes a missing part of the existing trust management models handling the subjectivity of recommendations our approach is based on the idea that a recommender s judgment method can be inferred and the recommended entity can be re evaluated according to the value system of the truster who is about to make a decision extraction of the judgment method involves abductive reasoning which is implemented in the proposed account using subjective logic this approach has been quantitatively compared with two other methods our experiments show that our proposed solution outperforms an extended version of the beta trust model a trust model without subjectivity elimination our suggested method for trust and reputation systems may also be applied to other systems that include a rating mechanism such as recommender systems abductive reasoning rating recommender

the navigability of web based information systems do teams achieve usability goals evaluating goal achievement with usability goals setting tool do teams achieve important usability goals most of the time further is goal achievement uniform or are practitioners more mindful of some goals than others this paper presents an empirical study on usability goal achievement in industry projects we used usability goal setting tool ugt a recommender system that helps teams set prioritize and evaluate usability goals the practitioner creates profiles for the product and its users based on these inputs ugt helps the practitioner break down high level usability goals into more specific goal parameters and provides recommendations examples and guidelines to assign weights to these parameters ugt suggests strategies to evaluate goal parameters after the design is ready and assign them scores ugt was used to collect data from 65 projects in the indian software industry in which participants assigned weights and scores to the goal parameters the 30 goal parameters suggested by ugt were found to be internally reliable and having acceptable granularity and coverage it was observed that goal parameter weights and scores correlated but only moderately another interesting observation was that more than a third of the important goal parameters did not score well we identify eight goal parameters that are typically high weighted but have poor weight score correlations we call these latent but important goal parameters design teams will do well to pay closer attention to these goal parameters during projects 2011 ifip international federation for information processing design tools latent goals methods usability goal parameters usability goals achievement an item based collaborative filtering method using item based hybrid similarity item based collaborative filtering is a preferred technique on recommender system it uses a value of item rating similarity to predict user s preference in this paper we include values of item attribute similarity to adjust the predicted rating equation for target item the results of item based collaborative filtering that hybrid item rating similarity and item attribute similarity techniques have mean absolute error mae less than a traditional item based collaborative filtering technique and others the proposed algorithm is efficient to predict better than traditional algorithm as shown in our experiments 2011 ieee collaborative filtering item based collaborative filtering recommendation system hybrid naive bayes classifier weighting and singular value decomposition technique for recommender system recommender system is tool for recommending products or services to customers which helps increase circulation

comparison mean absolute error mae between hybrid naive bayes classifier weighing and singular value decomposition technique hnbw svd and pure singular value decomposition technique svd that found hnbw svd yield lower mae than svd 2011 ieee naive bayes classifier weighing technique recommender system singular value decomposition technique improving rating estimation in recommender using demographic data and expert opinions memory based collaborative filtering algorithms have been widely adopted in many popular recommender systems however the rating data are very sparse which affects prediction accuracy greatly to solve this problem we use expert opinions to improve prediction accuracy firstly we propose a novel similarity measure in order to highlight users background then combining users ratings with expert opinions the prediction get a right balance in both expert professional opinions and similar users finally since svd based collaborative filtering algorithms shows good performance on the prevention of noise we use it to smooth the prediction experiments of movielens have shown that our proposed method improves recommendation quality obviously 2011 ieee collaborative filtering data sparsity demography expert recommendation preventing recommendation attack in trust based recommender systems despite its success similarity based collaborative filtering suffers from some limitations such as scalability sparsity and recommendation attack prior work has shown incorporating trust mechanism into traditional collaborative filtering recommender systems can improve these limitations we argue that trust based recommender systems are facing novel recommendation attack which is different from the profile injection attacks in traditional recommender system to the best of our knowledge there has not any prior study on recommendation attack in a trust based recommender system we analyze the attack problem and find that victim nodes play a significant role in the attack furthermore we propose a data provenance method to trace malicious users and identify the victim nodes as distrust users of recommender system feasibility study of the defend method is done with the dataset crawled from epinions website 2011 springer science business media llc science press china victim node attack data lineage trust propagation towards the automatic generation of a semantic web ontology for musical instruments in this study we present a novel hybrid system by developing a formal method of automatic ontology generation for web based audio signal processing applications an ontology is seen as a knowledge management structure that represents domain knowledge in a machine interpretable format it describes concepts and relationships within a particular domain in our case the domain of musical instruments the different tasks of ontology engineering including manual annotation hierarchical structuring and organisation of data can be laborious and challenging for these reasons we investigate how the process of creating ontologies can be made less dependent on human supervision by exploring concept analysis techniques in a semantic web environment only a few methods have been proposed for automatic ontology generation these are mostly based on statistical methods e g frequency of semantic tags that generate the taxonomy structure of ontologies as in the studies from bodner and songs 1 the algorithms that have been used for automatic ontology generation are hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac bi section k means 2 and formal concept analysis fcm formal concept analysis is a well established technique for identifying groups of elements with common sets of properties formal concept analysis has been used in many software engineering topics such as the identication of ob jects in legacy code or the identication and restructuring of schema in ob ject oriented databases 5 these works are important since ontologies provide the basis for information and database systems 6 in this study we present a novel hybrid ontology generation system for musical instruments the music ontology is a semantic web ontology that describes music related information e g release artist performance but does not provide models of musical instruments hence there is a need to develop a separate instrument ontology to deepen how music knowledge is represented on the se mantic web such complementary knowledge on musical instruments can be useful to develop music recognition and recommendation systems based on semantic reasoning this work is a preliminary step which focuses on automatic instrument taxonomy generation in ontology web language owl the taxonomy of musical instruments given by hornbostel and sachs 3 was considered as the basis for our instrument terms and initial hierarchical structure the hybrid system consists of three main units i musical instrument analysis ii formal concept analysis iii lattice pruning and hierarchical form generation in the musical instrument analysis unit the system analyses the relationships between 12 predened classes of musical instruments chordophones aerophones bowed struck reed pipe instruments edge instruments brass instruments double reeds single reeds with valves without valves true utes and 10 musical instrument individuals bassoon cello clarinet flute oboe piano saxophone trombone tuba violin using a multi layer perceptron mlp classier the underlying audio features used in the recognition and classication system are the line spectral frequencies lsf which are derived from linear predictive analysis of the signal the lsf characterise well the timbral differences between instruments since they are related to the formant structure of the sounds spectral envelope which is an important aspect of the timbre in this study we used a database of isolated tones of various pitches and dynamics to train and test the system in the formal concept analysis unit the binary relations obtained from the mlp outputs are used to identify the common attributes individuals shared by different objects and generate a concept lattice form in the lattice pruning unit the concepts are ordered in the hierarchical concept order and a well structured hierarchical form using reduced label ling technique is created finally the reduced concept lattice labels and the class hierarchy of the instrument ontology is coded to the ontology web language by using the owl api java library 4 the results have given a conclusive evidence in favor of the hierarchical similarity to the taxonomy of musical instruments used as a reference 3 to the authors knowledge this is the rst study to investigate automatic ontology generation system in the context of audio and music analysis in further stages the outcomes of this work may be used in an application to establish an automated mechanism to identify and classify music sources and annotate them with rdf meta data we will also incorporate a wider set of musical instruments and use more owl language features e g ob ject data properties which is important for resource description framework rdf triples subject s predicate p object o and semantic reasoning an instrument ontology is currently in development to be used as a ground truth for the further experiments 2011 springer verlag a component based open source framework for general purpose recommender systems recommender systems constitute a new field that provides nowadays an important support for information search from huge amounts of data since some of those information may be of interest of users but hard to be searched manually according to forecasts data production tends to grow more and more which places recommender systems on the way to play a key role in mining those data technologies about to be adopted in large scale require tools to enable their mass production and this fact is the key motivation of this work in this paper we present our research in the field of component based software engineering to design a framework for recommender systems we have elicited the requirements that all recommender systems might address and developed a vertical framework to support the development of such a sort of systems by designing components in accordance with those requirements with the idealize recommendation framework we intend to make the development of recommender systems an easier faster and standardized process as well as to perform the foundation of the technical terms to be used in the area 2011 acm component based

recommender systems rss are software tools and techniques providing suggestions for items such as movies cds or travels to be of use to a user in general a recommendation can be more compelling and useful if the context of the user is known for instance in a travel recommender the season of the travel or the group composition or the motivation of the travel are all important contextual factors that as a traveler normally does should be taken into account by a system to generate more relevant recommendations in this paper we show how a context aware mobile recommender system for places of interest pois selection can generate more effective recommendations than those produced by a non context aware version i e those normally provided to the city visitors by the local tourist office here

approach mines product descriptions from publicly available online specifications utilizes text mining and a novel incremental diffusive clustering algorithm to discover domain specific features generates a probabilistic feature model that represents commonalities variants and cross category features and then uses association rule mining and the k nearest neighbor machine learning strategy to generate product specific feature recommendations our recommender system supports the relatively labor intensive task of domain analysis potentially increasing opportunities for re use reducing time to market and delivering more competitive software products the approach is empirically validated against 20 different product categories using thousands of product descriptions mined from a repository of free software applications 2011 acm clustering domain analysis recommender systems the code orb supporting contextualized coding via at a glance views nier track while code is typically presented as a flat file to a developer who must change it this flat file exists within a context that can drastically influence how a developer approaches changing it while the developer clearly must be careful changing any code they probably should be yet more careful in changing code that recently saw major changes is barely covered by test cases and was the source of a number of bugs contextualized coding refers to the ability of the developer to effectively use such contextual information while they work on some changes in this paper we introduce the code orb a contextualized coding tool that builds upon existing mining and analysis techniques to warn developers on a line by line basis of the volatility of the code they are working on the key insight underneath the code orb is that it is neither desired nor possible to always present a code s context in its entirety instead it is necessary to provide an abstracted view of the context that informs the developer of which parts of the code they need to pay more attention to this paper discusses the principles of and rationale behind contextualized coding introduces the code orb and illustrates its function with example code and context drawn from the mylyn 11 project 2011 acm code orb contextualized coding recommendation systems software visualization dynamic updating of online recommender systems via feed forward controllers recommender systems have become an essential software component of many online businesses supporting customers in finding the items e g books on amazon movies on netflix songs on last fm they are interested in key to their success is the level of accuracy they achieve the more precisely they can predict how much a customer will enjoy an item the higher the profit that the business will make e g in terms of more purchases in quantifying the accuracy of recommender systems the evaluation methodology followed by researchers has so far neglected an important aspect that these businesses grow continuously over time both in terms of users and items the data structures used by the recommender system to compute predictions become stale and thus have to be updated regularly intuitively the more often the data structures are being updated the higher the accuracy achieved but the higher the computational cost afforded because of the extremely large volume of data being handled system administrators often perform the update at fixed intervals of time e g weekly fortnightly in an effort to balance accuracy versus cost we argue that such an approach benefits neither accuracy nor cost as businesses do not grow linearly in time thus risking the fixed update interval to be at times too coarse with negative impact on accuracy and at other times too fine grained with negative impact on cost we thus advocate for a self monitoring and self adaptive approach whereby the system monitors its own growth over time estimates the loss in accuracy it would endure if an update were not being performed based on the observed growth and dynamically decides whether the benefit of performing an update accuracy outweighs its computational cost using real data from the bibsonomy website we demonstrate how this simple technique enables system administrators to transparently balance these two conflicting requirements 2011 acm recommender systems self

lived code clones previous research has shown that refactoring code clones as soon as they are formed or discovered is not always feasible or worthwhile to perform since some clones never change during evolution and some disappear in a short amount of time while some undergo repetitive similar edits over their long lifetime toward a long term goal of developing a recommendation system that selectively identifies clones to refactor as a first step we conducted an empirical investigation into the characteristics of long lived clones our study of 13558 clone genealogies from 7 large open source projects over the history of 33 25 years in total found surprising results the size of a clone the number of clones in the same group and the method level distribution of clones are not strongly correlated with the survival time of clones however the number of developers who modified clones and the time since the last addition or removal of a clone to its group are highly correlated with the survival time of clones this result indicates that the evolutionary characteristics of clones may be a better indicator for refactoring needs than static or spatial characteristics such as loc the number of clones in the same group or the dispersion of clones in a system 2011 springer verlag code clones empirical study refactoring software evolution towards a recommendation system for the use of web based collaborative tools in factory planning web based collaborative tools also often referred to as web 2 0 tools facilitate multiple ways of cooperation such as the common work on documents improved task centered communication or the general coordination of tasks today s factory planning especially in the context of the digital factory concept is mainly focused on digital models and methods of visualization and simulation of the shop floor what it lacks is an explicit systematic approach for a profound support of cooperation through web based collaborative tools in similar knowledge intensive disciplines such as e learning or software engineering these tools have already become common practice and were examined in multiple case studies the article introduces an approach for systematic gathering and weighting of web 2 0 tool usage scenarios in the factory planning process which aims at a recommendation system for the use of those tools in factory planning context case based reasoning factory planning process morphological analysis recommendation system web 2 0 playing with refactoring identifying extract class opportunities through game theory in software engineering developers must often find solutions to problems balancing competing goals e g quality versus cost time to market versus resources or cohesion versus coupling finding a suitable balance between contrasting goals is often complex and recommendation systems are useful to support developers and managers in performing such a complex task we believe that contrasting goals can be often dealt with game theory techniques indeed game theory is successfully used in other fields especially in economics to mathematically propose solutions to strategic situation in which an individual s success in making choices depends on the choices of others to demonstrate the applicability of game theory to software engineering and to understand its pros and cons we propose an approach based on game theory that recommend extract class refactoring opportunities a preliminary evaluation inspired by mutation testing demonstrates the applicability and the benefits of the proposed approach 2010 ieee game theory quality metrics refactoring a enhanced trust model based on social network and online behavior analysis for recommendation the growth of social network

service recommender system web services provide a promising solution to an age old need of fast and flexible information sharing among people and businesses selection of web service has become a tedious job because of the increasing number of service providers providing services with similar functionality service registries are becoming very large preventing users from discovering desired service sometimes service users may not be aware of services that can be most beneficial to them therefore a framework for selection of web service that can meet the user s specific requirements is needed in this work we have proposed a personalized web service recommender system that will be very useful to the user in finding web service matching his her needs a recommender system helps product service user to deal with information overload and provides personalized recommendation to them there have been a few web service recommendation system in past but most of them are either content based or collaborative filtering based recommendation but all of these approaches have their own limitations in our work we have proposed a web service recommender system based on hybrid technique

software for example modern ides often provide quick fix suggestions for resolving compilation errors developers must scan this list and select the option they think will resolve the problem instead we propose that the ide should speculatively perform each of the suggestions in the background and provide information that helps developers select the best option for the given context we believe the

growth of newcomer competence challenges of globalization the transfer of entire projects to offshore locations the aging and renewal of core developers in legacy products the recruiting in fast growing internet companies and the participation in open source projects present similar challenges of rapidly increasing newcomer competence in software projects in particular culture differences communication complexity and the rapid influx of developers with little or no project knowledge common in these phenomena pose practical and research questions for software engineering for example how do different cultures impact project learning are there best practices for competence enhancing communication how to learn from the experiences of top developers to improve the training of newcomers what resources and tools can be provided to help newcomers learn faster and become more productive these questions sketch a project learning focused agenda needed to address outlined challenges we

collaborative filtering on a budget matrix factorization is a successful technique for building collaborative filtering systems while it works well on a large range of problems it is also known for requiring significant amounts of storage for each user or item to be added to the database this is a problem whenever the collaborative filtering task is larger than the medium sized netix prize data in this paper we propose a new model for representing and compressing matrix factors via hashing this allows for essentially unbounded storage at a graceful storage performance trade off for users and items to be represented in a pre defined memory footprint it allows us to scale recommender systems to very large numbers of users or conversely obtain very good performance even for tiny models e g

personalization recommendation service in enterprise information portal collaborative filtering algorithm is one of the most successful technologies for building recommender systems and is extensively used in personalized portal however existing collaborative filtering algorithms do not consider the change of user interests for this reason the systems may recommend unsatisfactory items when user s interest has changed to solve this problem by anglicizing and collecting user s information and behavior proposed and established user page matrix as a collaborative filtering algorithm interest

recommender systems information on the ratings of several features of items can be deployed to improve the quality of recommendations in recommender systems by incorporating them into similarity calculation between any two users or two items however the incremental information of these features has important impacts on recommender systems for example the complexity of similarity calculation is increased and more resources are consumed during the process for generating recommendations in this paper we propose several techniques by using this information to provide relevant recommendations

experts using communication history in distributed software development the communication is inefficient because of geographical and temporal distances affecting the team s performance and awareness the low level of awareness makes hard the task of finding the expert of a piece of source code delaying the implementation whenever a developer needs help to identify and to recommend the people with right knowledge to people in trouble during the implementation can improve the collaboration and awareness of the team because it can reduce the waiting time for an answer since the expert can be contacted directly in this paper we propose recommender system for expert location with the aim to reduce delays of finding the right person whenever somebody needs assistance during coding our

responsible for billions of dollars lost to industry but can cause lethal accidents although there has been much research into predicting such failures those predictions usually concentrate either on the technical or the social level of software development with the ever growing size of software teams we think that coordination among developers is becoming increasingly more important therefore we

to find and connect developers with relevant expertise existing recommendation systems typically model expertise based on file changes implementation expertise while these approaches have shown success they require a substantial recorded history of development for a project previously we have proposed the concept of usage expertise i e expertise manifested through the act of calling using a method in this paper we assess the viability of this concept by evaluating expert recommendations for the aspectj and eclipse projects we find that both usage and implementation expertise have comparable levels of accuracy which suggests that usage expertise may be used as a substitute measure we also find a notable overlap of method calls across both projects which suggests that usage expertise can be leveraged to recommend experts from different projects and thus for projects with little or no history on the evaluation of recommender systems with recorded interactions recommender systems are integrated development environment ide extensions which assist developers in the task of coding however since they assist specific aspects of the general activity of programming their impact is hard to assess in previous work we used with success an evaluation strategy using automated benchmarks to automatically and precisely evaluate several recommender systems based on recording and replaying developer interactions in this paper we highlight the challenges we expect to encounter while applying this approach to other recommender systems 2009 ieee ontology supported

enhancing stakeholder profiles to improve recommendations in online requirements elicitation requirements elicitation has long been recognized as a crucial activity in any software development project unfortunately the traditional elicitation practices do not scale well when applied to larger projects where knowledge is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed stakeholders as a result new distributed requirements elicitation tools have started to surface such as online forums and wiki pages in our previous work we introduced a framework for supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders the framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view conflicts interests and tradeoffs are identified as early as possible in this

system for debugging in large software development projects when a programmer is assigned a bug to fix she typically spends a lot of time searching in an ad hoc manner for instances from the past where similar bugs have been debugged analyzed and resolved systematic search tools that allow the programmer to express the context of the current bug and search through diverse data repositories associated with large projects can greatly improve the productivity of debugging this paper presents the design implementation and experience from such a search tool called debugadvisor the context of a bug includes all the information a programmer has about the bug including natural language text textual rendering of core dumps debugger output etc our key insight is to allow the programmer to collate this entire context as a query to search for related information thus debugadvisor allows the programmer to search using a fat query which could be kilobytes of structured and unstructured data describing the contextual information for the current bug information retrieval in the presence of fat queries and variegated data repositories all of which contain a mix of structured and unstructured data is a challenging problem we present novel ideas to solve this problem we have deployed debugadvisor to over 100 users inside microsoft in addition to standard metrics such as precision and recall we present extensive qualitative and quantitative feedback from our users copyright 2009 acm debugging recommendation systems search comparing the use of traditional and associative classifiers towards personalized recommendations nowadays there is a diversity of methods including data mining techniques available to be used in recommender systems however such systems still present numerous limitations an alternative data mining technique is the classification based on association which combines concepts from classification and association in this way association rules perform a predictive role these techniques not very extended have not been applied in the recommender systems area in order to provide recommendations more effectively in this work we suggest that associative classifiers can be also used in these type of systems therefore a revision about the recommender systems and the methods of associative classification is presented in addition a case study is described in which traditional and associative classifiers are evaluated and compared using data from recommender systems the results showed that both type of classifiers can be applied

knowledge based systems is built with the help of special purpose software components and programming environments such as rule engines or prolog interpreters other parts of the application like the web interface are however built with standard software development technology like java which means that not only the corresponding interfaces and data exchange mechanisms between the components have to be developed but also that the software developers have to work with different technologies or even programming paradigms in this paper we show how recent scripting extensions in a programming language like java can be exploited to develop highly flexible and extensible knowledge intensive applications the different advantages of such an approach are discussed based on the experiences gained from developing a scripting based software library for building knowledge based recommender applications srrs a recommendation system for security requirements despite the availability of

an object oriented system one relevant question is the following given a finite amount of resources what are the most critical classes on which testers should focus their attention in this paper we propose a new way for identifying critical classes classes often changed and playing a key role in the system we rely on error correcting graph matching ecgm and random walks to associate each class with a pair of values representative of the frequency of changes and the class overall connectivity with those two metrics we have a grid for assessing the criticality of any class in the system classes with high values in both metrics should be identified and reported to developers as a residual error in those classes will more likely deeply impact the whole system we show the feasibility of

revision information using the apache api documentation as an oracle we perform a quantitative evaluation of our method finding that our algorithm dramatically improves upon suade in this setting we

methods within the code that are relevant to a specific bug being fixed or enhancement made context is reified by a program in terms of a set of presentations windows a containing source code command executions and data files however it is not enough to save the latest context even when working on a single task programmers flip between contexts as they extend their understanding and when they decide on a change they may have to visit several contexts in order to address all possible ripple effects consequently we would like to record a history of contexts and be able to retrieve them as demanded by the current task we introduce a novel technique to obtain a context consisting of a set of methods relevant for the current task from a programmer s interactions with an ide using this context we demonstrate how to improve the ability of a programmer to recover the mental state associated with tasks and to facilitate the exploration of software through recommendation systems 2006 ieee an architecture based on multi agent system and data mining for recommending research papers and researchers looking for a useful material on the internet sometimes is a very difficult task due to the great quantity of information available on it finding the right material and maybe the right person on the internet could be a worthwhile result in this paper an architecture based on multi agent system and data mining for recommending research papers and researchers is presented through this system we intend to create virtual web communities to facilitate academic people sharing common

recommender systems an application oriented overview of personalization functions personalization is an interdisciplinary topic that has been discussed in the literature of marketing and information systems as well as in other research areas in this paper we present findings from a longitudinal research project on personalization of e commerce systems the findings were taken from interviews and software development projects with company partners action research the main contribution described in this paper is the personalization map the map provides an extensive overview on personalization functions that can be used to individualize and improve human computer interaction both in b2c and b2b e commerce environments in a first step the functions are classified according to their order of appearance in the buying process in a second step they are grouped into subcategories there is no single strategy for selecting successful personalization functions as the suitability varies depending on the industry and the goods sold most definitions of personalization are closely connected to the recommendation of items based on user preferences the personalization map shows that recommender systems are an interesting but rather small part of the universe of personalization functions using a software process for ontology based context aware computing a case study while research in context aware computing has produced useful results few software engineering solutions for context aware computing have been reported building upon concepts of the semantic web the pocap software process is an alternative towards supporting the development of ontology based context aware applications in order to demonstrate the use of pocap we present a case study of a web based recommender system extended with an owl based context model and a semantic enabled software infrastructure using pocap developers can take advantage of the organization and the dependence between pocap activities mainly

integrating product recommendation services in e markets online recommendation services widely known as recommender systems can support potential buyers by providing product recommendations that match their preferences when integrated into e markets recommendation services may offer important added value they can help online buyers to save time and make informed purchase decisions as well as emarket operators to respond to buyer product queries in a more efficient manner thus attracting more potential buyers on the other hand the variety of intelligent recommendation techniques that may be used to support such services can often prove complex and costly to implement toward this direction this chapter proposes a design process for deploying intelligent recommendation services in existing e markets in order to reduce the complexity of such kinds of software development to demonstrate the applicability of this approach the proposed process is applied for the integration of a

the last decade some of its aspects such as e testing are still in the development phase authoring tools and test banks for e tests are becoming an integral and indispensable part of e learning platforms and with the implementation of e learning standards such as ims qti e testing material can be easily shared and reused across various platforms with the knowledge available for re use and exam automation comes a new challenge making sure that created exams are free of conflicts a conflict exists in an exam if at least two questions within that exam are redundant in content and or if at least one question reveals the answer to another question within the same exam in this paper we propose using information retrieval techniques to detect conflicts within an exam our solution ice identification of conflicts in exams is based on the vector space model relying on tfidf weighing and the cosine function to calculate similarity ice also combines the hybrid recommendation techniques

approach for investigating open source software development time masha a multi agent system handling user and device adaptivity of web sites a user that navigates on the web using different devices should be characterized by a global profile which represents his behaviour when using all these devices then the user s profile could be usefully exploited when interacting with a site agent that is able to provide useful recommendations on the basis of the user s interests on one hand and to adapt the site presentation to the device currently exploited by the user on the other hand however it is not suitable to construct such a global profile by a software running on the exploited device since this device e g a mobile phone or a palmtop may have limited resources therefore in this paper we propose a multi agent architecture called masha handling user and device adaptivity of web sites in which each device is provided with a client agent that autonomously collects information about the user s behaviour associated to just that device however the user profile contained in this client is continuously updated with information coming from a unique server agent associated with the user such information is collected by the server agent from the different devices exploited by the user and represents a global user profile the third component of this architecture called adapter agent is capable to generate a personalized representation of the web site containing some useful recommendations derived by both an analysis of the user profile and the suggestions coming from other users exploiting the same device springer science business media b v 2006 device adaptivity information agents recommender systems web adaptivity javawock a java class recommender system based on collaborative filtering many software development platforms provide a large number of library components to make it easy to build high quality software on the other hand it became more and more difficult for developers to find useful components in each development context because the amount of components provided became too large today this paper proposes a recommender system that provides useful java components library class files to a developer based on collaborative filtering cf when a developer gives an unfinished java program to the system it investigates java library class files used in the given program and finds java programs that arc similar to the given program from a program repository then the system recommends to the developer java library class files that were used in the similar programs but were not used in the developer s program an experimental evaluation showed that the recommendation accuracy of the proposed system was much higher than that of a naive non cf

cannot find the appropriate technologies because there are vast amount of options today to solve this problem we propose a software technology recommendation method based on collaborative filtering cf in the proposed method at first questionnaires are collected from concerned engineers about their technical interest next similarities between an active engineer who gets recommendation and the other engineers are calculated according to the technical interests then some similar engineers are selected for the active engineer at last some technologies are recommended which attract the similar engineers an experimental evaluation showed that the proposed method can make accurate recommendations than that of a naïve non cf method 2005 ieee education information retrieval recommender systems

oriented knowledge management system and the growth of scientific knowledge in mis rascal a recommender agent for agile reuse as software organisations mature their repositories of reusable software components from previous projects will also grow considerably remaining conversant with all components in such a repository presents a significant challenge to developers indeed the retrieval of a particular component in this large search space may prove problematic further to this the reuse of components developed in an agile environment is likely to be hampered by the existence of little or no support materials we propose to infer the need for a component and proactively recommend that component to the developer using a technique which is consistent with the principles of agile methodologies our rascal recommender agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers to recommend to an individual developer components that are expected to be needed by that developer unlike many traditional recommender systems we may recommend items that the developer has actually employed previously we introduce a content based filtering technique for ordering the set of recommended software components and present a comparative analysis of applying this technique to a number of collaborative filtering algorithms we also investigate the relationship between the number of usage histories collected and recommendation accuracy our overall results indicate that rascal is a very promising tool for allowing developers discover reusable components at no additional cost springer

information seekers are unaware of the invisible crowd traveling in parallel to their course through the information landscape social navigation systems attempt to make the invisible crowd visible while social recommender systems try to introduce people directly however it is not clear whether users desire or will respond to social cues indicating the presence of other people when they are focused on a task to investigate this issue we created an online game playing task and paired subjects to perform the task based on their responses to a short survey about demographics and interests we studied how these factors influence task outcomes the interaction process and attitudes towards one s partner we found that demographic similarity affected how people interact with each other even though this information was not explicit while similarities or differences in task relevant interests did not our findings suggest guidelines for developing social recommender systems and show the

sharing large screens recommender systems serendipity a generalised approach to similarity based retrieval in recommender systems recommender systems for helping users to select from available products or services are increasingly common in electronic commerce typically in case based reasoning cbr approaches to product recommendation the items recommended are those that are most similar to a target query representing the elicited requirements of the user usually in practice the user is required to specify a single preferred value for each attribute in the query however we argue that a more flexible approach to requirements elicitation is necessary to meet the needs of different users ranging from those who know exactly what they are looking for to those whose requirements are vague in the extreme we show how the standard approach to similarity based retrieval can be generalised to support queries in which the user can enter any number of preferred values of a selected attribute and examine the potential benefits of the approach case based reasoning precision query recall recommender system requirements elicitation retrieval similarity interactive critiquing for catalog navigation in e commerce e commerce sites can have large essentially unbounded catalogs with large catalogs comes increasing difficulty for buyers in making use of standard search and browsing facilities particularly in the case of casual or occasional buyers and in the case of complex products the gap between a product s specifications and the buyer s understanding of need can be hard to bridge an effective e commerce catalog must map user needs to products that can fulfill them this paper describes an interactive incremental case based critiquing approach to solving this problem the approach is interactive and incremental so it does not require that the user have a completely specified need at the start the system is case based in that it emphasizes products over features or constraints and uses case based reasoning techniques for its product retrieval finally the approach is based on the critiquing of presented examples each critique redirecting the search to home in on appropriate products case based reasoning electronic commerce information retrieval recommender systems the development and prospect of personalized tv program recommendation systems 2002 ieee aspects

function discovery 2002 ieee since some application software provides users with too many functions it is often difficult to find those that are useful this paper proposes a recommendation system based on a collaborative filtering approach to let users discover useful functions at low cost for the purpose of improving productivity when using application software the proposed system automatically collects histories of software function execution usage histories from many users through the internet based on the collaborative filtering approach collected histories are used for recommending a set of candidate functions that may be useful to the individual user this paper illustrates conventional filtering algorithms and proposes a new algorithm suitable for recommendation of software functions the result of an experiment with a prototype recommendation system showed that the average ndpm of our algorithm was smaller than that of conventional algorithms and it also showed that the standard deviation of ndpm of our algorithm was smaller than that of conventional algorithms furthermore while every conventional algorithm had a case whose recommendation was worse than the

recommending or persuading the impact of a shopping agent s algorithm on user behavior this paper investigates the potential of recommendation agents for electronic shopping to influence human decision making by shaping user preferences specifically we examine how the type of information that is elicited by a shopping agent for use in its recommendation algorithm may affect consumers preference for product features and ultimately their product choice in an electronic marketplace a recommendation agent is defined as a software tool that a calibrates a model of a user s preference based on his her input and b uses this model to make personalized product recommendations we report the results of a controlled experiment that demonstrates that everything else being equal the inclusion of a product feature in a recommendation agent renders this feature more prominent in shoppers purchase decisions in addition we find that this effect is moderated by an important property of the marketplace the correlation structure among the features of available products we conclude that electronic shopping agents through the design of their recommendation algorithms have the potential to influence user preferences in a systematic fashion consumer behavior human decision making influence online shopping personalization persuasion product choice recommendation systems

large scale software projects in large and complex software projects the knowledge needed to elicit requirements and specify the functional and behavioral properties can be dispersed across many thousands of stakeholders unfortunately traditional requirements engineering techniques which were primarily designed to support face to face meetings do not scale well to handle the needs of larger projects we therefore propose a semi automated requirements elicitation framework which uses data mining techniques and recommender system technologies to facilitate stakeholder collaboration in a large scale distributed project our proposed recommender model is a hybrid one designed to manage the placement of stakeholders into highly focused discussion forums where they can work collaboratively to generate requirements in our approach statements of need are first gathered from the project stakeholders unsupervised clustering techniques are then used to identify cohesive and finely grained themes and a users profile is constructed according to the interests of the stakeholders in each of these themes this profile feeds information to a collaborative recommender which predicts stakeholders interests in additional forums the validity and effectiveness of the proposed recommendation framework is evaluated through a series of experiments using feature requests from

task imposes a high cognitive burden on developers who must juggle navigating the software understanding what they see with respect to their task and deciding how their task should be performed given what they have discovered pragmatic reuse tasks where source code is reused in a white box fashion is an example of a complex and error prone modification task the developer must plan out which portions of a system to reuse extract the code and integrate it into their own system in this paper we present a recommendation system that automates some aspects of the planning process undertaken by developers during pragmatic reuse tasks in a retroactive evaluation we demonstrate that our technique was able to provide the correct recommendation 64 of the time and was incorrect 25 of the time our

accessible through application programming interfaces apis we have observed many cases where apis are used in ways that are not the most effective we developed a technique and tool support to automatically detect such patterns of api usage in software projects the main hypothesis underlying our technique is that client code imitating the behavior of an api method without calling it may not be using the api effectively because it could instead call the method it imitates our technique involves analyzing software systems to detect cases of api method imitations in addition to warning developers of potentially reimplemented api methods we also indicate how to improve the use of the api applying our approach on 10 java systems revealed over 400 actual cases of potentially suboptimal

elicitation is the software engineering activity in which stakeholder needs are understood it involves identifying and prioritizing requirements a process difficult to scale to large software projects with many stakeholders this paper proposes stakerare a novel method that uses social networks and collaborative filtering to identify and prioritize requirements in large software projects stakerare identifies stakeholders and asks them to recommend other stakeholders and stakeholder roles builds a social network with stakeholders as nodes and their recommendations as links and prioritizes stakeholders using a variety of social network measures to determine their project influence it then asks the stakeholders to rate an initial list of requirements recommends other relevant requirements to them using collaborative filtering and prioritizes their requirements using their ratings weighted by their project influence stakerare was evaluated by applying it to a software project for a 30 000 user system and a substantial empirical study of requirements elicitation was conducted using the data collected from surveying and interviewing 87 stakeholders the study

individual users to elicit a recommendation that is satisfactory for the whole group in general most grss offer good results but each of them have only been tested in one application domain this paper describes a domain independent grs that has been used in two different application domains in order to create the group preference model we select two techniques that are widely used in other grss and

resolution of bug reports approaches have been developed that consider the use of machine learning approaches specifically support vector machines svm to automatically categorize bug reports into the appropriate component to help streamline the process of solving a bug one drawback of an svm based approach is that the results of categorization can be uneven across various components in the system

automating bug report categorization an approach similar to previous ones based on an svm classifier and term frequency inverse document frequency svm tf idf an approach using latent dirichlet
