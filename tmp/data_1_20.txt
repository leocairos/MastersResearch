forging high quality user stories towards a discipline for agile requirements 2015 ieee user stories are a widely used notation for formulating requirements in agile development projects despite their popularity in industry little to no academic work is available on assessing their quality the few existing approaches are too generic or employ highly qualitative metrics we propose the quality user story framework consisting of 14 quality criteria that user story writers should strive to conform to additionally we introduce the conceptual model of a user story which we rely on to design the aqusa software tool aqusa aids requirements engineers in turning raw user stories into higher quality ones by exposing defects and deviations from good practice in user stories we evaluate our work by applying the framework and a prototype implementation to three user story sets from industry aqusa nlp qus framework requirements engineering requirements quality user stories a mapping study on requirements engineering in agile software development 2015 ieee agile software development asd methods have gained popularity in the industry and been the subject of an increasing amount of academic research although requirements engineering re in asd has been studied the overall understanding of re in asd as a phenomenon is still weak we conducted a mapping study of re in asd to review the scientific literature 28 articles on the topic were identified and analyzed the results indicate that the definition of agile re is vague the proposed benefits from agile re included lower process overheads a better requirements understanding a reduced tendency to over allocate development resources responsiveness to change rapid delivery of value and improved customer relationships the problematic areas of agile re were the use of customer representatives the user story requirements format the prioritization of requirements growing technical debt tacit requirements knowledge and imprecise effort estimation we also report proposed solutions to the identified problems agile development mapping study requirements engineering scrum a systematic literature review on agile requirements engineering practices and challenges 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved unlike traditional software development methods agile methods are marked by extensive collaboration i e face to face communication although claimed to be beneficial the software development community as a whole is still unfamiliar with the role of the requirements engineering practices in agile methods the term agile requirements engineering is used to define the agile way of planning executing and reasoning about requirements engineering activities moreover not much is known about the challenges posed by collaboration oriented agile way of dealing with requirements engineering activities our goal is to map the evidence available about requirements engineering practices adopted and challenges faced by agile teams in order to understand how traditional requirements engineering issues are resolved using agile requirements engineering we conducted a systematic review of literature published between 2002 and june 2013 and identified 21 papers that discuss agile requirements engineering we formulated and applied specific inclusion and exclusion criteria in two distinct rounds to determine the most relevant studies for our research goal the review identified 17 practices of agile requirements engineering five challenges traceable to traditional requirements engineering that were overcome by agile requirements engineering and eight challenges posed by the practice of agile requirements engineering however our findings suggest that agile requirements engineering as a research context needs additional attention and more empirical results are required to better understand the impact of agile requirements engineering practices e g dealing with non functional requirements and self

collaboration among agile teams findings from two case studies 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved stakeholders collaboration is required to develop requirements in agile software development requirements engineering and agile methods share common grounds as they both focus on stakeholder collaboration the key issue is finding a way to study collaboration driven by requirements in geographically distributed agile teams in this paper we aim to propose a framework to study collaboration driven by requirements among agile teams and determine the impact of their collaboration patterns on the iteration performance we define collaboration in terms of communication as information exchange among members and awareness knowledge of others two case studies were conducted to examine communication and awareness network patterns among distributed agile teams data were collected through questionnaires semi structured interviews and onsite observation the findings revealed that the framework aids in determining the core members collaboration trends clustering tendency communication and awareness reciprocity of the teams small worldliness and centralisation behaviour of the networks and iteration performance of the agile teams the framework has implications for the industrial practitioners i e managers to learn about their team s collaboration in order to take measures for performance improvement at the same time the researchers can use this framework to study other social aspects in variable settings to produce more empirical results agile methods

nerv methodology a lightweight process for addressing non functional requirements in agile software development 2015 ieee agile software development has become very popular around the world in recent years with methods such as scrum and extreme programming xp literature suggests that functionality is the primary focus in agile processes while non functional requirements nfrs are either ignored or ill defined however for software to be of good quality both functional requirements frs and nfrs need to be taken into consideration lack of attention to nfrs has been documented to be the cause of failure for many software projects hence special attention needs to be focused on nfrs in agile software development requirements elicitation implementation in design development and validation are important activities of software development agile has good processes to elicit functional requirements that are captured as user stories however nfrs elicitation has not been given enough attention within agile processes additionally reasoning and validating of nfrs have been lacking this research proposes the nerv methodology nonfunctional requirements elicitation reasoning and validation in

agile processes in this context this research conducted an exploratory study to investigate how requirements engineering is used in projects that adopt agile methodologies for this a systematic mapping was performed and it identified the engineering requirements techniques that are running in the industry the problems and limitations in projects that adopt agile methodologies the low involvement of users and the constant changes of requirements were identified as the main challenges to be overcome agile methodologies requirements systematic mapping effective hybrid tool for global software development research india publications requirements engineering is as its name suggests the engineering discipline of establishing user requirements and specifying software systems there are many definitions of requirements engineering however they all share the idea that requirements involves finding out what people want from a computer system and understanding what their needs mean in terms of design requirements engineering is closely related to software engineering which focuses more on the process of designing the system that users want perhaps the most concise summary comes from barry boehm requirements are designing the right thing as opposed to software engineering s designing the thing right boehm 1981 requirement engineering is the important phase in the software

in online requirements forums what do practitioners vary in using scrum springer international publishing switzerland 2015 background agile software development has become a popular way of developing software scrum is the most frequently used agile framework but it is often reported to be adapted in practice objective thus we aim to understand how scrum is adapted in different contexts and what are the reasons for these changes method using a structured interview guideline we interviewed ten german companies about their concrete usage of scrum and analysed the results qualitatively results all companies vary scrum in some way the least variations are in the sprint length events team size and requirements engineering many users varied the roles effort estimations and quality assurance conclusions many variations constitute a substantial deviation from scrum as initially proposed for some of these variations there are good reasons sometimes however the variations are a result of a previous non agile hierarchical organisation agile processes industrial case study scrum variations us2startool generating i∗ models from user stories copyright 2015 for this paper by its authors in agile methods the requirements are represented by user stories however this model does not allow a good visualization of context in which a story is inserted reducing the understanding of the system as a whole on the other hand the i∗ model presents dependencies among organizational actors and the understanding of the context in which a requirement is inserted this paper presents an implementation of an automated solution as a tool to mapping user stories into i∗ models us2startool adding a support for agile development environment us2startool can help requirements engineer in

story a comparative study of software tools for user story management 2014 elsevier b v all rights reserved context user stories have become widely accepted in agile software development consequently a great number of software tools that provide inter alia support for practices based on user stories have emerged in recent years these tools may have different features and focus in terms of support for agile requirements engineering re concepts and practices objective the present study aims to provide a deep insight into the current capabilities and future trends of software support for agile re practices based on user stories method a comparative qualitative study of a set of agile software tools has been conducted according to the following criteria coverage of the key functional requirements support for basic agile re concepts and practices and user satisfaction with the tool the criteria for tool selection were diversity of software tools high rating on the user stories community web site http www userstories com and availability for review results the results show a generally good coverage of key functional requirements related to management of user stories and epics high level release planning and low level iteration planning on the other hand user role modeling and persona support have not been addressed at all and it has been found that requirements for acceptance testing support were completely covered by only one tool more importantly the study has revealed significant differences in the way different tools support agile re concepts and practices if at all finally qualitative analysis of user reviews has demonstrated that practitioners prefer tools that are easy to set up easy to learn easy to use and easy to customize over more sophisticated but simultaneously more demanding tools conclusion although the progress that has been made since the inception of these tools is quite clear there is still room for improvements in terms of support for various agile re practices within a specific agile process agile practices requirements engineering software support user story management integrating user stories and i∗ models a systematic approach copyright 2015 scitepress science and technology publications user stories are a common way to describe requirements in agile methods however the use of user stories is restricted since they offer only a limited view of the whole system in contrast one of the features of the i∗ framework is provides a visual representation of the actors involved in a system and the goals that are to be met this allows for a better understanding of the problem as well as for a better overview and evaluation of alternative solutions in addition i∗ models consider the early phases of requirements engineering while user stories cover the later phases in this context this paper presents an approach to map user stories to i∗ models and vice versa aiming at providing a bigger picture of the system as a whole a case study to evaluate this work is also presented suggesting the viability of the approach agile requirements i∗ models user stories weekly round trips from norms to requirements and tests an industrial experience report 2015 ieee seac is a major software provider in italy in the area of business management with a focus on norms and human resources seac is re engineering their huge legacy system to c sql server to minimise the risks associated with such reengineering project seac has adopted an incremental and agile process model which produces small and frequent releases of new incremental modules that replace a portion of the legacy system at a time since the seac software handles business activities that are highly dependent on norms such as the contracts of employees the taxation of incomes and salaries the pension contributions one of the key challenges is to support a smooth transformation of norms into requirements into code and eventually into test cases used to verify that norms have been implemented as prescribed by the law the se research unit at fbk has been involved to introduce a set of practices aimed at supporting such transformation so

tensions among agility requirements engineering practices and continuous system architecture adaptation besides it improves the step of continuous architecture adaptation as established in the deui field by employing model driven architectures thus while this approach profits from the conceptual framework by means of continuous feedback on how to technically better support the classical tension between agility and requirement engineering it also takes advantage of modeldriven architecture to cope with the tension between agility and distributable user interface architecture changes affine

methodologies the medov helps stakeholders in their everyday work with minimal impact on agility the method also ensures an active role of business users a wide picture what usually is the problem for agile development and definition of non functional requirements what the even bigger problem is the medov ensures that no unnecessary features are produced so that no extra code is created and

centre for hci design at city university london talks about the role of ambiguity in requirements engineering ambiguity can be defined as a specification that makes it possible to interpret a problem feature in at least two different ways the human in the loop makes requirements ambiguity almost inevitable one example of ambiguity in action is in agile development at the start of a project requirements are deliberately underspecified and therefore ambiguous during the project a more precise understanding of requirements emerges from different forms of communication and collaboration between different stakeholders ambiguity can be positively useful if used in a right manner ambiguities ambiguity requirements towards model driven game engineering for serious educational games

models development models such as the waterfall model spiral model rational unified process agile and many others have looked at efficiency of the development processes these approaches have helped practitioners improve immensely on the efficiency and efficacy of the product development processes however product quality needs to be measured by parameters that go beyond the traditional criteria like performance reliability reusability etc a product that has any interaction with the end user also needs to meet a fundamental requirement of being user friendly development models such as jad joint application development have focused on making products user friendly apart from achieving the technical soundness in a product the success of the product also largely depends on how well the product addresses the primary requirements of the user such as desirability relevance and usability not meeting these requirements leads to bad user experience which in turn can actually lead to failure of the product this paper discusses some of the misconceptions and myths that exist in the industry regarding requirements engineering re and user experience design uxd and how user needs

stakeholders use stories to stimulate conversations that create and convey understanding of software requirements some authors have argued that asd methods have limited applicability to large scale projects because agile stories are not sufficient to capture the complexities of up front design this paper reports a 2 5 year field study of how an asd team for a complex software system adapted the user story concept and the scrum approach the team sought to create a convention for representing agile stories which could capture the complexities of the system requirements without burdening the team with unneeded documentation they developed eight different ways to represent a story the core representation of the approach was called a hyperepic a structured collection of closely related hyperstories hyperepics required 90 99 fewer words than conventional specifications because of their dense form hyper epics were not useful for other phases in the design build processes the team evolved a design build work practice that proceeded in stages in each stage stories underwent a one or more transformations each transformation represented stories differently to create varied kinds of understandings among different stakeholder sets the team was able to gain the benefits of asd faster development cycles less documentation rapid adaptation to insights and conditions 2012 ieee there s never enough time doing requirements under resource constraints and what requirements engineering can learn from agile development while requirements engineering textbooks state that a requirements specification must be complete in real life projects we are always starting too late with too few resources so we can t do everything the software development community has solved a similar problem not having enough resources to implement everything that was asked for by introducing agile development methods which offer ways of segmenting the overall project and choosing which parts to allocate resources to this paper is about how insights from that agile development community can be applied to requirements engineering activities for any agile or non agile development project key terms in agile development such as working product and user story must be mapped intelligently to terms in requirements engineering and not simply copied the product of requirements engineering is not the same as the product being implemented by developers 2011 ieee agile development requirements engineering systems projects triage show and tell play in combining natural language with user interaction for specifying behavior in search of improving the ways to create meaningful systems from requirements specifications this paper combines the showing and telling of how a system should behave using scenario based programming and the language of live sequence charts we suggest how user interaction with the system and user written requirements in natural language can interleave to create specifications through an interface that is both natural and agile 2011 iadis intelligent interfaces live sequence charts requirement engineering scenario based programming towards agile security risk management in re and beyond little attention has been given so far to the process of security risk management at the early stages of system development security has been addressed by isolated security assurance practices some of which consider risks and mitigations but they do not provide an overview of the overall security state of the system being developed this paper takes the position that 1 these isolated security assurance practices should be fully integrated and should be embedded in short iterations of risk assessment treatment and acceptance providing input for updating security requirements and for security risk management and that 2 available empirical data from public catalogs and databases should be used as a source of expertise to leverage past experiences and therefore reduce although not eliminate subjectivity of human judgment borrowing from the agile software development and project management philosophy we introduce the idea of a light weight agile approach to security risk management integrated to the development life cycle 2011 ieee agile software development information security risk management secure engineering security assurance support tool to the validation process of functional requirements the activity of validating identified requirements for an information system helps to improve the quality of a requirements specification document and consequently the success of a project although various different support tools to requirements engineering exist in the market there is still a lack of automated support for validation activity in this context the purpose of this paper is to make up for that deficiency with the use of an automated tool to provide the resources for the execution of an adequate validation activity the contribution of this study is to enable an agile and effective follow up of the scope established for the requirements so as to lead the development to a solution which would satisfy the real necessities of the users as well as to supply project managers with relevant information about the maturity of the analysts involved in requirements specification 2005 ieee requirements

completeness percentage furthermore the application of an automated version of the proposed approach saved an extra 43 of the time saved by its manual application this had direct implications on improving requirements and design deliverables of agile software development processes nevertheless users raised a number of concerns that have been considered to outline prospective phases of this research 2011 the institution of engineering and technology information requirements analysis for holonic manufacturing systems in a virtual environment the design and development of holonic manufacturing systems requires careful and sometimes risky decision making to ensure that they will successfully satisfy the demands of an ever changing market in this paper the authors propose a methodology for a holonic manufacturing systems requirement analysis that is based on a virtual reality approach and aimed at assisting designers of such systems along the entire systems design and development process exploiting virtual reality helps the user collect valid information quickly and in a correct form by putting the user and the information support elements in direct relation with the operation of the system in a more realistic environment a prototype software system tool is designed to realise the features outlined in each phase of the methodology a virtual manufacturing environment for matching the physical and the information model domains is utilised to delineate the information system requirements of holonic manufacturing systems implementation a set of rules and a knowledge base is appended to the virtual environment to remove any inconsistency that could arise between the material and the information flows during the requirement analysis holonic

a hybrid recommender system for finding relevant users in open source forums and using audio and collaboration technologies for distributed requirements elicitation and documentation a semantic and collaborative platform for agile requirements evolution the characteristics of web based and community oriented social software are very useful in the context of software engineering in general and requirements engineering in particular their ease of use transparency of communication user orientation self organization and emergent nature resulting from a continual social feedback are particularly relevant to an agile requirements definition exercise the reason is that agile requirements are inherently meant to be collaboration intensive however while the benefits of social platforms are valuable they are necessary and not sufficient in themselves for making the exercise effective the emerging social software engineering discipline is about enabling community driven creation management and deployment of software by applying methods processes and tools in online environments in this paper we report our work on a semantic and collaborative platform that combines the virtues of social software principles and the semantic web concepts to enable knowledge assisted agile requirements definition 2010 ieee collaborative and semantic requirements definition semantic assistance social software engineering transition to agile development rediscovery of important requirements engineering practices many organizations have started to use agile development processes to speed up the development cycle and to improve the ability of the company in reacting to changing requirements adopting agile practices may happen as a revolution where all old practices are removed or as a more gradual process in this paper we discuss lessons learnt in two agile transition processes based on our experience agile processes can be used in embedded software development for products the challenges include the varying size of user requirements the role of system requirements and architecturally significant requirements it is difficult for large organizations to be agile work allocation for a large number of different teams with different competencies tends to decrease speed and increase the role of design and management we conclude that agile development in this context needs very skilled developers and has to be a combination of new and old practices 2010 ieee best practices requirements engineering a usability pattern based requirements analysis method to bridge the gap between user tasks and application features in software development it is important to mediate various concerns coming from user experience ux designers and application developers in agile user centered design agile ucd there is a special role called specialist who is dedicated to implement application features as well as to monitor user experiences however the specialist normally has difficulty in linking user tasks to be accessed via a user interface ui into application feature entities in addition the specialist may also have some unsettled usability risks that might result in the failure of meeting certain usability criteria and passing acceptance tests to alleviate these difficulties of the specialists in agile ucd we propose a usability pattern based requirement analysis method this method uses standardized and common representations of requirements specification to bridge the gap between user tasks and related application features of a ui it also provides a guideline to allow the specialist to reduce usability risks in an early stage by reflecting usability factors of ui design patterns to an application design a case study has been conducted to show how users can

work on a recommendation system for knowledge assisted agile requirements evolution k gilere we treat requirements engineering as a special case of knowledge engineering and emphasize the fact that providing a domain knowledge edge can impart agility to the requirements definition exercise the approach differs from existing agile methods in that it seamlessly incorporates a domain knowledge base into an agile requirements definition framework and explicitly provides to requirement analysts relevant online domain specific recommendations based on underlying ontologies the framework presents a domain knowledge seed to requirement analysts the seed provides a view of core features in a given domain and associated knowledge elements such as business processes rules policies partial data models use cases and test cases these in turn are mapped with agile requirements elements such as user stories features tasks product backlog sprints and prototype plans the requirement analyst can evolve the seed to suit her specific project needs as she modifies and evolves the seed specification she receives domain specific online recommendations to improve the correctness consistency and completeness of her requirement specification documents and executable models using the domain knowledge seed as a point of departure provides a jump start to her project each exercise of requirements definition thus becomes an evolution from the seed instead of the traditional clean slate requirements engineering re that typically starts from the scratch hence the term kgilere we elaborate how k gilere helps in practicing the essence of agile doctrines while defining software requirements by providing just in time recommendations copyright 2010 acm collaborative and semantic requirements definition domain specific recommendations knowledge assisted agile from formal requirements to automated web testing and prototyping use cases and user interface prototypes are agile techniques used to specify required functionalities of an object oriented system testing can find most errors of the software and ensure that the requirement specifications are satisfied by the application we can derive test cases from use cases and run them in user interfaces but we do it in a mechanical way in this paper we propose a new approach for automating the generation of user interface prototypes and test cases for web applications starting from a formalization of the requirements based on controlled use cases extended with the system glossary and the user interface specifications we automatically generate web pages and test cases which are passed as parameters for an automated web testing tool springer verlag london limited 2010 automation requirements engineering software prototyping software testing interaction pattern categories pragmatic engineering of knowledge based systems the application of knowledge based consultation and documentation systems is apart from large industrial projects often also beneficial for small to mid sized enterprises yet their design and implementation still is a tedious and costly task we motivate that customized ui and interaction patterns constitute a pragmatic technique for supporting especially requirements engineering and thus are capable of considerably promoting real world projects in this paper we introduce abstract categories

the quality of requirements story cards 2010 igi global generating user stories in groups communicating about system requirements with user stories is a distinctive feature of agile software development methods while user stories make system requirements intelligible to both customers and technical developers they also create new challenges for the requirements elicitation process such as personal bias and requirements coverage in this study we propose that when elicited from groups instead of individuals the number of stories generated the uniqueness and the comprehensiveness of the stories is likely to increase a lab experiment design is delineated and partially completed future research will need to be conducted to determine conclusions 2009 springer berlin heidelberg group story telling requirements elicitation user stories little design up front a design science approach to integrating usability into agile requirements engineering in recent years design science has gained wide recognition and acceptance as a formal research method in many disciplines including information systems design science research in human computer interaction is not so abundant hci is a discipline primarily focusing on design evaluation and implementation where design plays the role as a process as well as an artefact in this paper we present a design science approach using little design up front to integrate the user centred design perspective into agile requirements engineering we also present the results of two agile projects to validate the proposition that incorporating ucd perspective into agile software development improves the design quality of software systems 2009 springer berlin heidelberg agile requirements engineering design science usability efficient building of interactive applications guided by requirements models the analysis of functional and non functional requirements of an interactive application not only encompasses the descriptive aspects of its functionality and the user and system restrictions it must also satisfy user needs such as usability along with system needs such as reliability intermod is an interactive application design methodology with agile characteristics which proposes the use of incremental models to define requirements configure presentation and develop functionality this poster is focused on the requirements of the intermod methodology for the efficient construction of interactive applications these models include user system task and dialog models an example created with a tool that follows these

requirements engineering for health care information systems examples and prospects designing healthcare information systems is a challenge to software engineering theory and practice many requirements engineering re methods demand user participation clear functional objectives and a well defined context of use these demands are hard to meet in the healthcare domain which is characterized by high diversity complexity and little time and money to spend there are many examples of healthcare software systems that have failed due to lacking investment in the early phases of design and requirements analysis we have developed methods for gathering detailed observational data about care and communication practice in this article we explain how this data can be used for iterative demanddriven requirements elicitation and to answer design questions the examples are taken from structured observation of actors situations information usage and activities at two norwegian hospitals we regard this approach as a useful supplement to other re methods in particular for agile development methods 2009 ieee requirements analysis as a guide for the process of organising and developing an interactive application 2009 iadis developing interactive applications according to quality criteria can be done within the environment of a methodology centred on the user and by means of the agile but ordered realisation of its components the analysis of functional and non functional requirements does not only encompass the descriptive aspects of functionality it must also satisfy user needs such as usability as understood in terms of efficiency effectiveness and satisfaction of use at the same time the analysis should cover other important conditioning factors such as system reliability and security this article is based on the intermod methodology whose objective is to facilitate the design of quality interactive applications intermod proposes using user centred models which allow to define the application requirements and to describe the human computer dialogue both of them are embedded in an early prototype evaluation process the requirements models the presentation model and the software model are involved in this process several tools guide the process described in intermod and here we focus on diagram diagram gathers the requirements models

simplified and tailored assessment method for story cards based requirements engineering practices based on the cmm which is poorly addressed at cmm cmm does not cover how the quality of the

phase two third of the projects are failed because of ambiguous and incomplete user requirements and poor quality of the requirements acceptance testing is also one of the key issues which is often left unsolved or uncovered to verify user requirements in xp agile software development methodology to solve these problems we propose a new improved requirement elicitation gathering process framework for story cards in xp to improve quality of user stories to capture functional and non functional user requirements on story cards our approach involves adopting acceptance tests right from

requirement engineering into agile software development agile software engineering approaches gain more and more popularity in today s development organizations the need for usable products is also a growing factor for organizations thus their development processes have to react on mis demand and have to offer approaches to integrate the factor usability in their development processes the approach presented in this paper evaluates how agile software engineering models consider activities of usability engineering to ensure the creation of usable software products the user centeredness of the two agile se models scrum and xp has been analyzed and the question of how potential gaps can be filled without loosing the process agility is discussed as requirements play a decisive role during software development in software engineering as well as usability engineering therefore different user centered requirements that ensure the development of usable systems served as basis for the gap analysis springer verlag berlin heidelberg 2007 agile software engineering usability engineering user centered requirements are use cases beneficial for developers using agile requirements agile teams commonly use user stories conversations with on site customers and test cases to gather requirements some agile teams like to add other artifacts such as use cases to provide more detail to the agile requirements this paper presents the results of a controlled experiment aimed to learn whether use cases could help agile requirements and indirectly to find if agile requirements techniques are sufficient in the study subjects were given requirements for three maintenance tasks as use cases or agile requirements or both we found that subjects using use cases spent less time understanding requirements in comparison to subjects not using use cases in addition the presence of the use cases helped subjects to ask better questions to the on site customer however we could not determine if subjects using use cases understood the requirements better we conclude that the inclusion of use cases in agile requirements could benefit agile teams 2007 ieee the application of user stories for strategic planning in agile development stories are typically used to define small independent pieces of functionality that have value for the customer they are most often used to define requirements

service interfaces identifying application key knowledge through system operations modeling one of the problems associated with complex systems engineering is identifying the system knowledge relevant to build system implementation system operations are an essential part of this knowledge software and system engineering standards highlight the importance of system operations templates for a concept of operations document are available from different standard bodies in the context of requirements engineering and specification however specific guidelines for operations modeling are not usually provided this paper introduces an approach to systematically model system operations the cornerstone for this is an operations metamodel this metamodel is presented within this paper and has been defined using uml 2 x the baseline for the metamodel is a schema also introduced within the paper which formalizes system operations in terms of commands acting on systems inputs to the system and different kinds of outputs classified into responses notifications and alarms operations models as presented here comprise system knowledge essentials from a functional point of view but reduced in size compared to the whole system specification they can be deployed in several ways this paper presents their use as drivers for system development and validation from early lifecycle stages 2007

interaction modeling deriving static and dynamic concepts from software requirements using sophisticated tagging natural language requirements specifications form the basis for the subsequent phase of the information system development process namely the development of conceptual schemata both the textual as well as the conceptual representations are not really appropriate for being thoroughly captured and validated by the requirement holders i e the end users therefore in our approach the textual specifications are firstly linguistically analyzed and translated into a so called conceptual predesign schema that schema is formulated using an interlingua which is based on a lean semantic model thus allowing users to participate more efficiently in the design and validation process after validation the predesign schema is mapped to a conceptual representation e g uml the sequence of these translation and transformation steps is described by the niba workflow this paper focuses on the

understanding users by observing and interviewing end users and other stakeholders phase 2 defines interaction takes the output from phase 1 and creates use cases from the user research these use cases are used as input to phase 3 design ui where prototypes are iteratively created and evaluated it is recommended that understanding users should involve anticipating activities such as reading background literature gathering information on competing products and conducting early customer interviews agile friendly use case methods should be promoted so that time and effort are not wasted in addition user interface ui should be undermined as independently empowered teams evolving code in parallel without coordinating each other a user story driven software development method software

prototyping is an essential part of the user centered design process ucd since the emergence of touch based mobile devices in recent years a broad range of efforts has been taken to adapt professional prototyping tools to the mobile context however none of the existing mobile prototyping solutions adapts sufficiently to the needs of multidisciplinary teams or considers the experience of the users working environments explicitly our goal was to develop a mobile prototyping tool that supports the users in their tasks with special attention to the context of use we especially considered the holistic experience relating all tasks of the human centered design process our approach of requirements engineering focused on ux methods to get a deep insight not only on pragmatic features but also emotional demands i e hedonic qualities therefore we tried to strengthen the hedonic qualities to support action mode usage for leveraging creative potentials we d like to reveal whether and to what extent a detailed look on ux can ensure the working progress efficiency and motivation of a multidisciplinary software engineering team practicing agile methods we will illustrate this by presenting

model based requirements in agile development 2014 ieee two fundamental principles and values of agile methods are customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software and the improvement of the communication process by continuous stakeholders involvement but how to deal with customers satisfaction and find a better visualization model at the requirements level which stakeholders can understand and be involved in an agile development context also how this visualization model enhancement can guarantee consistency between agile requirements artefacts e g user stories and domain models thus to answer these questions this paper presents the snapmind framework this framework aims to make the requirements modelling process more user centered through the definition of a visual requirements language based on mind maps model driven and domain specific language techniques moreover through these techniques the snapmind framework focuses on support for consistency between user stories and the domain models using a model animation technique called snapshots the framework was applied to an industrial case study to investigate its feasibility agile software requirements domain

publishing switzerland 2014 all rights are reserved in software engineering the programmer depends on precise descriptions of the system to be built to get these descriptions analysts condense the knowledge about the domain from observations and discussions with the users the people that will eventually work with the software the users have to communicate their knowledge about the domain and express their needs with tbpm we have shown that it is possible for end users to express themselves by means of process models we now transfer these findings to other fields in software engineering we investigated in the discipline of requirements engineering especially in the context of agile software development approaches from practitioners we learned that during the first iterations code tends to be thrown away completely since the initial requirements gathering phase is intentionally kept lean we therefore introduced the concept of need finding iterations and tackle this problem in our research we develop a holistic workshop methodology to kick off agile software development projects in which a shared understanding among stakeholders is to be fostered discussions that would arise after a software prototype has been implemented are encouraged to be conducted at an earlier stage by making use of an adequate modeling solution we propose story prototypes which essentially enrich user stories with control flow information and thereby are enhanced to show the big picture rather than just individual aspects of the system to be built in such a kickoff workshop we encourage a

customer and development team in agile methods this paper provides a new user stories voice aimed to ease and automate analysis of objects and their action from the user story using ooadare object

innovation space for the cooperation of users researchers and even companies to participate in a common process to develop innovative solutions an architecture for a living lab for ir has been proposed in 1 in this paper we propose a method and system that foregoes the inherent openness of the living lab and implements a private living lab to enable the cooperation between a research department agile software development and requirements engineering quality assurance this allows the research department to overcome the limitations of the usual approach to gold standard based evaluation while preserving its positive aspects the definition of a private living lab may be seen along the lines of the separation of public and private clouds in cloud computing copyright 2013 acm

by simplifying the concepts of agent oriented modeling for requirements engineering we have found that this kind of modeling can be used in various software development projects including agile software development for agile requirements engineering to verify our theories we ve used our practice in two real life projects this paper contains summary of ideas and practices developed during these projects copyright 2013 scitepress agent oriented modeling agile development requirements engineering systems modeling user stories improving user involvement through a model driven requirements approach model driven web engineering mdwe methodologies have proven to be a mature way of developing web applications dramatically increasing productivity during development however after more than a decade of evolution the artifacts and processes used to gather requirements have not changed substantially at the same time the capacity of quickly adapting to emergent domain specific requirements a feature that became popular with the massive adoption of agile approaches has become hard to achieve in these methodologies in this context in order to implement this kind of refined requirements as fast as possible changes are usually applied directly to the generated application losing the abstraction and its inherent productivity provided by the model driven process another way of implementing this kind of changes is by extending the modeling language but this implies a high effort and again a consequent productivity loss in this paper we propose a model driven development approach called mockre that captures requirements using user interface prototypes mockups that end users can understand completely the process and tooling presented here allows end users to express requirements annotating the mockups with textual descriptions and also generating a running application in the same way that mdwe environments do developers may later use these initial specifications placed by end users as valuable model concepts that can be refined through direct coding in a non intrusive way through this strategy mockre intends to make a more extensive reuse of end users specifications

study the application of agile practices for requirements prioritization in distributed and outsourced projects is a relatively recent trend hence not all of its facets are well understood this exploratory study sets out to uncover the concepts that practitioners in a large software organization use in the prioritization process and the practices that they deem good we seek to provide a rich analysis and a deep understanding of three cases in an exploratory study that was carried out in a large and mature company widely recognized for its excellence and its engagement in outsourced software development we used in depth interviews for data collection and grounded theory techniques for data analysis our exploration efforts yielded the following findings i understanding requirements dependencies is of paramount importance for the successful deployment of agile approaches in large outsourced projects ii next to business value the most important prioritization criterion in the setting of outsourced large agile projects is risk iii the software organization has developed a new artefact that seems to be a worthwhile contribution to agile software development in the large delivery stories which complement user stories with technical implications effort estimation and associated risk the delivery stories play a pivotal role in requirements prioritization iv the vendor s domain knowledge is a key asset for setting up successful client developer collaboration v the use of agile prioritization practices depends on the type of project outsourcing arrangement our findings contribute to the empirical software engineering literature by bringing a rich analysis of cases in agile and distributed contexts from a vendor s perspective we also discuss the possible

pass the requirements analysis phase this paper describes a multi lingual web based tool that allows multiple users and stakeholders of different possibly geo graphically dispersed organizations to perform requirements analysis activities in an agile and collaborative manner and in close cooperation with software archi tects and engineers the tool relies upon the identification and semi formal de scription of use cases e g following cockburn s approach and the resource ori ented extensions proposed by the servus design methodology it supports to define relationships between use cases their representation in uml their step wise refinement and mapping to existing or emerging capabilities of service plat forms as well as the specification of associated test cases the tool is illustrated by its use in the european research project envirofi this project aims at ana lyzing and specifying the generic and specific enablement of the future internet core platform for the environmental

design with video change and user involvement are two major challenges in agile software projects as change and user involvement usually arise spontaneously reaction to change validation and communication are thereby expected to happen in a continuous way in the project lifecycle we propose evolutionary scenario based design which employs video in fulfilling this goal and present a new idea that supports video production using secondlife like virtual world technology 2012 acm requirements engineering scenario based design video prototyping virtual world a framework to diminish the gap between the business specialist and the software designer requirements engineering establishes the process for defining requirements as one in which elicitation modeling and analysis are tasks which must be carried out this process should involve different stakeholders and their different viewpoints among these stakeholders there is the software designer responsible for creating models based on the information gathered by business specialists however this communication channel may create some noise that leads to information being lost this loss produces a semantic gap between what is desired and what will be developed the semantic gap is characterized by inconsistencies in the requirements represented by scenarios user stories in a behavior driven context and by the conceptual model this paper presents an interactive approach to the agile requirements modeling thus fostering greater consistency between the artifacts of the scenarios and the conceptual model this consistency is ensured by using a mind model specification which will serve as a basis for transforming the definitions of the scenario and generating a conceptual model represented by a uml class diagram the mind model represents the main role of this approach and functions as a bond that represents the business entities thus enabling the requirements to be more consistent with the reality of the business

improvement attempt that failed while extreme programming xp relies on certain principles it requires an extensive set of tools to enable an effective execution of its practices in many companies putting stories on the board may not be sufficient for managing rapidly changing requirements the objective of this paper is to report the results from a study where a requirement management tool the storymanager was developed to meet the needs of a xp project team the tool was used in a case project where a mobile application for real markets was produced the tool was dropped by the team only after two releases the reasons of the process improvement failure are addressed in this paper the principal results show that the tool was found to be too difficult to use and that it failed to provide as powerful a visual view as the paper pen board method the implications of these findings are addressed for both the practitioners and researchers in the field requirements engineering process selection at hewlett packard the requirements engineering re processes used at hewlett packard hp are many and varied they range from informal to formal on projects that are short agile and at internet speed as well as long and methodical ones typically the re approach is influenced by business drivers as well as constraints or attributes of the project some of the major attributes that affect hp s re selection process include level of understanding of the user s domain needs project size and complexity schedule resources cost quality expectations project personnel expertise development model in house versus outsourced tolerance for requirements volatility cost of requirements changes during development and after release and the speed at which changes can be applied to the product after release attributes of the re approach for two hp projects are examined in this paper the first project is agile with an internet speed release schedule it is based on experience with the web site and consumer award winning eservices hpshopping com organization the other project is large complex and makes use of outsourced development it is based on experience with the development of an hp worldwide ww it customer communications system that cuts across all of hp s businesses many different re processes are used at hp the most effective ones are those customized to closely fit the business drivers and project attributes 2004 ieee generalized release planning for product line architectures this paper elaborates on the coordination and management of evolving software product lines where development teams work around a shared and reusable domain infrastructure the trend away from monolithic applications and towards component based product line architectures has enabled the development of complex software to be undertaken by autonomous and often geographically separated teams delivering a complete product or product line requires significant coordination to bring the separate development streams together at agreed upon points in the schedule for integration and test in such complex development scenarios a release matrix has been proposed as a generalization of release planning and tracking addressing multiple products components and their interdependencies at an enterprise or marketplace level here we describe the results of the practical trials of the release matrix that provide pragmatic guidelines for its use and indicate areas for future research relationships to established processes including requirements engineering and configuration management are clarified and the methodology neutral technique is shown to complement work in areas including agile methods and component contracts springer verlag 2004 imaginate a case is given on how one programmer completed agile development by sitting down with the user and creating the software in real time focus is on the lessons learned throughout the process which are as follows users like results and care less about the technology they like to be involved reuse is great but use is better and tools should support rapid development with feedback not rup not xp multiple letters to be or not to be explicit multiple letters going faster testing the web application an overview is given on test first design and the creation of testable code for web applications it is explained how testing has been critical to building evant s application at speed while maintaining a high degree of quality usage centered engineering for web applications a flexible model driven approach for engineering web applications that succeeds through a focus on user interface design and usability is presented its simple model driven techniques work well for novel applications and integrate readily with lightweight or agile development processes under compressed development schedules zero tolerance construction software construction is addressed focusing on the issue that major catastrophic losses can be prevented by focusing on preventing the triggering mechanism from occurring the no broken windows concept is introduced as a solution to this problem get ready for agile methods with care traditionalists advocate using extensive planning codified processes and rigorous reuse to make development an efficient and predictable activity that gradually matures toward perfection although many of their advocates consider the agile and plan driven software development methods polar opposites synthesizing the two can provide developers with a comprehensive spectrum of tools and options adapting xp to complex application domains extreme programming xp works well for small software projects in not too complex application domains in many of these projects the rather simple requirements engineering of xp customers write story cards has proved suitable but today we are more often faced with complex application domains in which the classical xp techniques will not suffice the tutorial shows how to adapt extreme programming to complex application domains and to demanding development tasks we focus mainly on the requirements engineering part and show how to enhance xp with interviews scenarios and system visions we also integrate the management perspective into the planning game reconciling this perspective to users needs we propose a set of best practice methods we have used in a
